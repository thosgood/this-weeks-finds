# TODO

- something better than `" "` in the tables in e.g. week049
- ask john to check wallpaper tilings in week267
- check list in week273
- check images in week258
- check images (alhambra tiles) in week267
- graph in week261

- HTML output?
    + https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html#building-images-with-tikz
- **do images with `![](file.jpg){ width=80% }`**
    + might need the `implicit_figure` option (`pandoc -f markdown+implicit_figures`)
