# DATE {#week262}

I'm done with teaching until fall, and now I'll be travelling a lot. I
just got back from Singapore. It's an incredibly diverse place. I
actually had to buy a book to understand all the foods! I'm now
acquainted with the charms of
[appam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appam), [kaya
toast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_toast), and [babi buah
keluak](http://pachome1.pacific.net.sg/~ccchia/recipe03.html). But I
didn't get around to trying a
[chendol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cendol), a
[bandung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung_%28drink%29), or a [Milo
dinosaur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_%28drink%29#Use), even
though they're all available in every [hawker
center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre).

Today I'll talk about quantum technology in Singapore, atom chips,
graphene transistors, nitrogen-vacancy pairs in diamonds, a new
construction of e~8~, and a categorification of quantum \mathfrak{sl}(2).

But first - the astronomy pictures of the week!

First another planetary nebula - the "Southern Ring Nebula":

1) Hubble Heritage Project, Planetary Nebula NGC 3132,
`http://heritage.stsci.edu/1998/39/index.html`

This bubble of hot gas is .4 light years in diameter. You can see *two*
stars near its center. The faint one is the white dwarf remnant of the
star that actually threw off the gas forming this nebula. The gas is
expanding outwards at about 20 kilometers per second. The intense
ultraviolet radiation from the white dwarf is ionizing this gas and
making it glow.

The Southern Ring Nebula is 2000 light years from us. Much closer to
home, here's a new shot of the frosty dunes of Mars:

These horn-shaped dunes are called "barchans"; you can read more about
them at ["Week 228"](#week228). The frost is carbon dioxide,
evaporating as the springtime sun warms the north polar region. Here's
another photo, taken in February:

:::

3) HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment), Defrosting
northern dunes, `http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007193_2640`

The dark stuff pouring down the steep slopes reminds me of water, but
they say it's dust!

(If you click on these Mars photos, you'll get some amazing larger
views.)

Meanwhile, down here on Earth, I had some good conversations with
mathematicians and physicists at the National University of Singapore
(NUS), and also with Artur Ekert and Valerio Scarani, who work here:

4) Centre for Quantum Technologies, `http://www.quantumlah.org/`

I like the name "quantumlah". "Lah" is perhaps the most famous word
in Singlish: you put it at the end of a sentence for emphasis, to convey
"acceptance, understanding, lightness, jest, and a medley of other
positive feelings". Unfortunately I didn't get to hear much Singlish
during my visit.

The Centre for Quantum Technologies is hosted by NUS but is somewhat
independent. It reminds me a bit of the Institute for Quantum Computing
- see ["Week 235"](#week235) - but it's smaller, and still getting
started. They hope to take advantage of the nearby semiconductor
fabrication plants, or "fabs", to build stuff.

They've got theorists and experimentalists. Being overly theoretical
myself, I asked: what are the most interesting real-life working devices
we're likely to see soon? Ekert mentioned "quantum repeaters" -
gadgets that boost the power of a beam of entangled photons while still
maintaining quantum coherence, as needed for long-distance quantum
cryptography. He also mentioned "atom chips", which use tiny wires
embedded in a silicon chip to trap and manipulate cold atoms on the
chip's surface:

5) Atomchip Group, `http://www.atomchip.org/`

6) Atom Optics Group, Laboratoire Charles Fabry, Atom-chip experiment,
`http://atomoptic.iota.u-psud.fr/research/chip/chip.html`

There's also a nanotech group at NUS:

7) Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Initiative, National University of
Singapore, `http://www.nusnni.nus.edu.sg/`

who are doing cool stuff with "graphene" - hexagonal sheets of carbon
atoms, like individual layers of a graphite crystal:

::: {align="center"}
[![](graphene.jpg)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene)
:::

Graphene is closely related to buckyballs (see
["Week 79"](#week79)) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (see
["Week 258"](#week258)).

Some researchers believe that graphene transistors could operate in the
terahertz range, about 1000 times faster than conventional silicon ones.
The reason is that electrons move much faster through graphene.
Unfortunately the difference in conductivity between the "on" and
"off" states is less for graphene. This makes it harder to work with.
People think they can solve this problem, though:

Ekert also told me about another idea for carbon-based computers:
"nitrogen-vacancy centers". These are very elegant entities. To
understand them, it helps to know a bit about diamonds. You really just
need to know that diamonds are crystals made of carbon. But I can't
resist saying more, because the geometry of these crystals is
fascinating.

A diamond is made of carbon atoms arranged in tetrahedra, which then
form a cubical structure, like this:

::: {align="center"}
[![](diamond-conventional-unit-cell.gif)](http://newton.ex.ac.uk/research/qsystems/people/sque/diamond/structure/)
:::

9) Steve Sque, Structure of diamond,
`http://newton.ex.ac.uk/research/qsystems/people/sque/diamond/structure/`

Here you see 4 tetrahedra of carbon atoms inside a cube. Note that
there's one carbon at each corner of the cube, and also one in the
middle of each face. If that was all, we'd have a "face-centered
cubic". But there are also 4 more carbons inside the cube - one at the
center of each tetrahedron!

If you look really carefully, you can see that the full pattern consists
of two interpenetrating face-centered cubic lattices, one offset
relative to the other along the cube's main diagonal!

While the math of the diamond crystal is perfectly beautiful, nature
doesn't always get it quite right. Sometimes a carbon atom will be
missing. In fact, sometimes a cosmic ray will knock a carbon out of the
lattice! You can also do it yourself with a beam of neutrons or
electrons. The resulting hole is called a "vacancy". If you heat a
diamond to about 900 kelvin, these vacancies start to move around like
particles.

Diamonds also have impurities. The most common is nitrogen, which can
form up 1% of a diamond. Nitrogen atoms can take the place of carbon
atoms in the crystal. Sometimes these nitrogen atoms are isolated,
sometimes they come in pairs.

When a lone nitrogen encounters a vacancy, they stick together! We then
have a "nitrogen-vacancy center". It's also common for 4 nitrogens to
surround a vacancy. Many other combinations are also possible - and when
we get enough of these nitrogen-vacancy combinations around, they form
larger structures called "platelets".

diamond, in Properties, Growth and Application of Diamond, eds. Maria
Helena Nazare and A. J. Neves, EMIS Datareviews Series, 2001, 127-130.

A nice thing about nitrogen-vacancy centers is that they act like spin-$1$
particles. In fact, these spins interact very little with their
environment, thanks to the remarkable properties of diamond. So, they
might be a good way to store quantum information: they can last 50
microseconds before losing coherence, even at room temperature. If we
could couple them to each other in interesting ways, maybe we could do
some "spintronics", or even quantum computation:

11) Sankar das Sarma, Spintronics, American Scientist 89 (2001),
516-523. Also available at
`http://www.physics.umd.edu/cmtc/earlier_papers/AmSci.pdf`

Lone nitrogens are even more robust carriers of quantum information:
their time to decoherence can be as much as a millisecond! The reason is
that, unlike nitrogen-vacancy centers, lone nitrogens have "dark
spins" - their spin doesn't interact much with light. But this can
also makes them harder to manipulate. So, it may be easier to use
nitrogen-vacancy centers. People are busy studying the options:

But regardless of whether anyone can coax them into quantum computation,
I like diamonds. Not to own - just to contemplate! I told you about the
diamond rain on Neptune back in ["Week 160"](#week160). And in
["Week 193"](#week193), I explained how diamonds are the closest
thing to the E8 lattice you're likely to see in this 3-dimensional
world.

The reason is that in any dimension you can define a checkerboard
lattice called D_n, consisting of all $n$-tuples of integers that sum to
an even integer. Then you can define a set called D_n^+^ by taking two
copies of the D_n lattice: the original and another shifted by the
vector (1/2,...,1/2). D~8~^+^ is the E~8~ lattice, but D_3 is the
face-centered cubic, and D_3^+^ is the pattern formed by carbons in a
diamond!

In case you're wondering: in math, unlike crystallography, we reserve
the term "lattice" for a discrete subgroup of R^n that's isomorphic
to Z^n. The set D_n^+^ is only closed under addition when n is even.
So, the carbons in a diamond don't form a lattice in the strict
mathematical sense. On the other hand, the face-centered cubic really is
a lattice, the D_3 lattice - and this is secretly the same as the A_3
lattice, familiar from stacking oranges. It's one of the densest ways
to pack spheres, with a density of

\pi  /(3√2)   ≈   0.74

The D_3^+^ pattern, on the other hand, has a density of just

(\pi √3)/16   ≈   0.34

This is why ice becomes denser when it melts: it's packed in a close
relative of the D_3^+^ pattern, with an equally low density.

(Do diamonds become denser when they melt? Or do they always turn into
graphite when they get hot enough, regardless of the pressure? Inquiring
minds want to know. These days inquiring minds use search engines to
answer questions like this... but right now I'd rather talk about
E~8~.)

As you probably noticed, Garrett Lisi stirred up quite a media sensation
with his attempt to pack all known forces and particles into a theory
based on the exceptional Lie group E~8~:

15) Garrett Lisi, An exceptionally simple theory of everything,
available as [`arXiv:0711.0770`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0770)

Part of his idea was to use Kostant's triality-based description of
E~8~ to explain the three generations of leptons - see
["Week 253"](#week253) for more. Unfortunately this part of the
idea doesn't work, for purely group-theoretical reasons:

16) Jacques Distler, A little group theory,
`http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001505.html`\
A little more group theory,
`http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/001532.html`

There would also be vast problems trying get all the dimensionless
constants in the Standard Model to pop out of such a scheme - or to
stick them in somehow.

Meanwhile, Kostant has been doing new things with E~8~. He's mainly
been using the complex form of E~8~, while Lisi needs a noncompact real
form to get gravity into the game. So, the connection between their work
is somewhat limited. Nonetheless, Kostant enjoys the idea of a theory of
everything based on E~8~.

He recently gave a talk here at UCR:

17) Bertram Kostant, On some mathematics in Garrett Lisi's "E~8~
theory of everything", February 12, 2008, UCR. Video and lecture notes
at `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/kostant/`

He did some amazing things, like chop the 248-dimensional Lie algebra of
E~8~ into 31 Cartan subalgebras in a nice way, thus categorifying the
factorization

248 = 8 \times 31

To do this, he used a copy of the 32-element group (Z/2)^5 sitting in
E~8~, and the 31 nontrivial characters of this group.

Even more remarkably, this copy of (Z/2)^5 sits inside a copy of
\mathrm{SL}(2,F~32~) inside E~8~, and the centralizer of a certain element of
\mathrm{SL}(2,F~32~) is a product of two copies of the gauge group of the
Standard Model! What this means - if anything - remains a mystery.

Indeed, pretty much everything about E~8~ seems mysterious to me, since
nobody has exhibited it as the symmetry group of anything more
comprehensible than E~8~ itself. This paper sheds some new light this
puzzle:

17) José Miguel Figueroa-O'Farrill, A geometric construction of the
exceptional Lie algebras F_4 and E~8~, available as
[`arXiv:0706.2829`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2829).

The idea here is to build the Lie algebra of E~8~ using Killing spinors
on the unit sphere in 16 dimensions.

Okay - what's a Killing spinor?

Well, first I need to remind you about Killing vectors. Given a
Riemannian manifold, a "Killing vector" is a vector field that
generates a flow that preserves the metric! A transformation that
preserves the metric is called an "isometry", and these form a Lie
group. Killing vector fields form a Lie algebra if we use the ordinary
Lie bracket of vector fields, and this is the Lie algebra of the group
of isometries.

Now, if our manifold has a spin structure, a "Killing spinor" is a
spinor field \psi such that

D~v~\psi = k v\psi

for some constant k for every vector field v. Here D~v~\psi is the
covariant derivative of \psi in the v direction, while v\psi is defined using
the action of vectors on spinors. Only the sign of the constant k really
matters, since rescaling the metric rescales this constant.

It's a cute equation, but what's the point of it? Part of the point is
this: the action of vectors on spinors

V \otimes S \to S

has a kind of adjoint

S \otimes S \to V

This lets us take a pair of spinor fields and form a vector field. This
is what people mean when they say spinors are like the "square root"
of vectors. And, if we do this to two *Killing* spinors, we get a
*Killing* vector! You can prove this using that cute equation - and
that's the main point of that equation, as far as I'm concerned.

Under good conditions, this fact lets us define a "Killing
superalgebra" which has the Lie algebra of Killing vectors as its even
part, and the Killing spinors as its odd part.

In this superalgebra, the bracket of two Killing vectors is just their
ordinary Lie bracket. The bracket of a Killing vector and a Killing
spinor is defined using a fairly obvious notion of the "Lie derivative
of a spinor field". And, the bracket of two Killing spinors is defined
using the map

S \otimes S \to V

which, as explained, gives a Killing vector.

Now, you might think our "Killing superalgebra" should be a Lie
superalgebra. But in some dimensions, the map

S \otimes S \to V

is skew-symmetric. Then our Killing superalgebra has a chance at being a
plain old Lie algebra! We still need to check the Jacobi identity. And
this only works in certain special cases:

If you take S^7 with its usual round metric, the isometry group is
\mathrm{SO}(8), so the Lie algebra of Killing vectors is \mathfrak{so}(8). There's an
8-dimensional space of Killing spinors, and the action of \mathfrak{so}(8) on this
gives the real left-handed spinor representation S~8~^+^. The Jacobi
identity holds, and you get a Lie algebra structure on

\mathfrak{so}(8) \oplus  S~8~^+^

But then, thanks to triality, you knock yourself on the head and say "I
could have had a V~8~!" After all, up to an outer automorphism of
\mathfrak{so}(8), the spinor representation S~8~^+^ is the same as the
8-dimensional vector representation V~8~. So, your Lie algebra is the
same as

\mathfrak{so}(8) \oplus  V~8~

with a certain obvious Lie algebra structure. This is just \mathfrak{so}(9). So,
it's nothing exceptional, though you arrived at it by a devious route.

If you take S^8 with its usual round metric, the Lie algebra of Killing
vector fields is \mathfrak{so}(9). Now there's a 16-dimensional space of Killing
spinor fields, and the action of \mathfrak{so}(9) on this gives the real
(non-chiral) spinor representation S~9~. The Jacobi identity holds, and
you get a Lie algebra structure on

\mathfrak{so}(9) \oplus  S~9~

This gives the exceptional Lie algebra f_4!

Finally, if you take S^15^ with its usual round metric, the Lie algebra
of Killing vector fields is \mathfrak{so}(16). Now there's a 128-dimensional space
of Killing spinor fields, and the action of \mathfrak{so}(16) on this gives the
left-handed real spinor representation S~16~^+^. The Jacobi identity
holds, and you get a Lie algebra structure on

\mathfrak{so}(16) \oplus  S~16~^+^

This gives the exceptional Lie algebra e~8~!

In short, what Figueroa-O'Farrill has done is found a nice geometrical
interpretation for some previously known algebraic constructions of f_4
and e~8~. Unfortunately, he still needs to verify the Jacobi identity in
the same brute-force way. It would be nice to find a slicker proof. But
his new interpretation is suggestive: it raises a lot of new questions.
He lists some of these at the end of the paper, and mentions a really
big one at the beginning. Namely: the spheres S^7, S^8 and S^15^ all
show up in the Hopf fibration associated to the octonionic projective
line:

S^7 \to S^15^ \to S^8

Does this give a nice relation between \mathfrak{so}(9), f_4 and e~8~? Can someone
guess what this relation should be? Maybe e~8~ is built from \mathfrak{so}(9) and
f_4 somehow.

I also wonder if there's a Killing superalgebra interpretation of the
Lie algebra constructions

e~6~ = \mathfrak{so}(10) \oplus  S~10~ \oplus  \mathrm{u}(1)

and

e~7~ = \mathfrak{so}(12) \oplus  S~12~^+^ \oplus  \mathfrak{su}(2)

These would need to be trickier, with the \mathrm{u}(1) showing up from the fact
that S~10~ is a complex representation, and the \mathfrak{su}(2) showing up from
the fact that S~12~^+^ is a quaternionic representation. The algebra is
explained here:

18) John Baez, The octonions, section 4.3: the magic square, available
at `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node16.html`

A geometrical interepretation would be nice!

Finally - my former student Aaron Lauda has been working with Khovanov
on categorifying quantum groups, and their work is starting to really
take off. I'm just beginning to read his new papers, but I can't
resist bringing them to your attention:

19) Aaron Lauda, A categorification of quantum \mathfrak{sl}(2), available as
[`arXiv:0803.3652`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3652).

Aaron Lauda, Categorified quantum \mathfrak{sl}(2) and equivariant cohomology of
iterated flag varieties, available as
[`arXiv:0803.3848`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3848).

He's got a *2-category* that decategorifies to give the quantized
universal enveloping algebra of \mathfrak{sl}(2)! And similarly for all the irreps
of this algebra!

There's more to come, too....

**Addenda:** Starting this Week, you can see more discussion and also
*questions I'm dying to know the answers to* over at the [*n*-Category
Café](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/03/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_23.html).
Whenever I write This Week's Finds, I come up with lots of questions.
If you can help me with some of these, I'll be really grateful.
