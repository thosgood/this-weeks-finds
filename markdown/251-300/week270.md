# October 11, 2008 {#week270}

Greg Egan has a new novel out, called "Incandescence" - so I want to
talk about that. Then I'll talk about three of my favorite numbers: 5,
8, and 24. I'll show you how each regular polytope with 5-fold
rotational symmetry has a secret link to a lattice living in twice as
many dimensions. For example, the pentagon is a 2d projection of a
beautiful shape that lives in 4 dimensions. Finally, I'll wrap up with
a simple but surprising property of the number 12.

But first: another picture of Jupiter's moon Io! Now we'll zoom in
much closer. This was taken in 2000 by the Galileo probe:

the Day, `http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap000606.html`

Here we see a vast plain of sulfur and silicate rock, 250 kilometers
across - and on the left, glowing hot lava! The white dots are spots so
hot that their infrared radiation oversaturated the detection equipment.
This was the first photo of an active lava flow on another world.

If you like pictures like this, maybe you like science fiction. And if
you like hard science fiction - "diamond-scratching hard", as one
reviewer put it - Greg Egan is your man. His latest novel is one of the
most realistic evocations of the distant future I've ever read. Check

The story features two parallel plots. One is about a galaxy-spanning
civilization called the Amalgam, and two of its members who go on a
quest to our Galaxy's core, which is home to enigmatic beings that may
be still more advanced: the Aloof. The other is about the inhabitants of
a small world orbiting a black hole. This is where the serious physics
comes in.

I might as well quote Egan himself:

As you can tell, this is a novel of ideas. You have to be willing to
work through these ideas to enjoy it. It's also not what I'd call a
feel-good novel. As with "Diaspora" and "Schild's Ladder", the main
characters seem to become more and more isolated and focused on their
work as they delve deeper into the mysteries they are pursuing. By the
time the mysteries are unraveled, there's almost nobody to talk to.
It's a problem many mathematicians will recognize. Indeed, near the end
of "Diaspora" we read: "In the end, there was only mathematics".

So, this novel is not for everyone! But then, neither is This Week's
Finds.

In fact, I was carrying "Incandescence" with me when in mid-September
I left the scorched and smoggy sprawl of southern California for the
cool, wet, beautiful old city of Glasgow. I spent a lovely week there
talking math with Tom Leinster, Eugenia Cheng, Bruce Bartlett and Simon
Willerton. I'd been invited to the University of Glasgow to give a
series of talks called the 2008 Rankin Lectures. I spoke about my three
favorite numbers, and you can see the slides here:

3) John Baez, My favorite numbers, available at
`http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/numbers/`

I wanted to explain how different numbers have different personalities
that radiate like force fields through diverse areas of mathematics and
interact with each other in surprising ways. I've been exploring this
theme for many years here. So, it was nice to polish some things I've
written and present them in a more organized way. These lectures were
sponsored by the trust that runs the Glasgow Mathematical Journal, so
I'll eventually publish them there. I plan to add a lot of detail that
didn't fit in the talks.

I began with the number 5, since the golden ratio and the five-fold
symmetry of the dodecahedron lead quickly to a wealth of easily enjoyed
phenomena: from Penrose tilings and quasicrystals, to Hurwitz's theorem
on approximating numbers by fractions, to the 120-cell and the Poincare
homology sphere.

After giving the first talk I discovered the head of the math
department, Peter Kropholler, is a big fan of Rubik's cubes. I'd never
been attracted to them myself. But his enthusiasm was contagious,
especially when he started pulling out the unusual variants that he
collects, eagerly explaining their subtleties. My favorite was the
Rubik's dodecahedron, or "Megaminx":

4) Wikipedia, Megaminx, `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaminx`

Then I got to thinking: it would be even better to have a Rubik's
icosahedron, since its symmetries would then include M~12~, the smallest
Mathieu group. And it turns out that such a gadget exists! It's called
"Dogic":

5) Wikipedia, Dogic, `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogic`

The Mathieu group M~12~ is the smallest of the sporadic finite simple
groups. Someday I'd like to understand the Monster, which is the
biggest of the lot. But if the Monster is the Mount Everest of finite
group theory, M~12~ is like a small foothill. A good place to start.

Way back in ["Week 20"](#week20), I gave a cute description of
M~12~ lifted from Conway and Sloane's classic book. If you get 12
equal-sized balls to touch a central one of the same size, and arrange
them to lie at the corners of a regular icosahedron, they don't touch
their neighbors. There's even room to roll them around in interesting
ways! For example, you can twist 5 of them around clockwise so that this
arrangement:

                               1
     
                          5         2
                               6
                            
                            4     3

becomes this:

                               5
     
                          4         1
                               6
                            
                            3     2

We can generate lots of permutations of the 12 outer balls using twists
of this sort - in fact, all even permutations. But suppose we only use
moves where we first twist 5 balls around clockwise and then twist 5
others counterclockwise. These generate a smaller group: the Mathieu
group M~12~.

Since we can do twists like this in the Dogic puzzle, I believe M~12~
sits inside the symmetry group of this puzzle! In a way it's not
surprising: the Dogic puzzle has a vast group of symmetries, while M~12~
has a measly

8 \times 9 \times 10 \times 11 \times 12 = 95040

elements. But it'd still be cool to have a toy where you can explore
the Mathieu group M~12~ with your own hands!

The math department lounge at the University of Glasgow has some old
books in the shelves waiting for someone to pick them up and read them
and love them. They're sort of like dogs at the pound, sadly waiting
for somebody to take them home. I took one that explains how Mathieu
groups arise as symmetries of "[Steiner
systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_system)":

6) Thomas Beth, Dieter Jungnickel, and Hanfried Lenz, Design Theory,
Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 1986.

Here's how they get M~12~. Take a 12-point set and think of it as the
"projective line over F11" - in other words, the integers mod 11
together with a point called infinity. Among the integers mod 11, six
are perfect squares:

{0,1,3,4,5,9}

Call this set a "block". From this, get a bunch more blocks by
applying fractional linear transformations:

z \mapsto (az + b)/(cz + d)

where the matrix

(a b)\
(c d)\

has determinant $1$. These blocks then form a "(5,6,12) Steiner system".
In other words: there are 12 points, 6 points in each block, and any set
of 5 points lies in a unique block.

The group M~12~ is then the group of all transformations of the
projective line that map points to points and blocks to blocks!

If I make more progress on understanding this stuff I'll let you know.
It would be fun to find deep mathematics lurking in mutant Rubik's
cubes.

Anyway, in my second talk I turned to the number 8. This gave me a great
excuse to tell the story of how Graves discovered the octonions, and
then talk about sphere packings and the marvelous \mathrm{E}_8 lattice, whose
points can also be seen as "integer octonions". I also sketched the
basic ideas behind Bott periodicity, triality, and the role of division
algebras in superstring theory.

If you look at my slides you'll also see an appendix that describes two
ways to get the \mathrm{E}_8 lattice starting from the dodecahedron. This is a
nice interaction between the magic powers of the number 5 and those of
the number 8. After my talk, Christian Korff from the University of
Glasgow showed me a paper that fits this relation into a bigger pattern:

7) Andreas Fring and Christian Korff, Non-crystallographic reduction of
Calogero-Moser models, Jour. Phys. A 39 (2006), 1115-1131. Also
available as
[`arXiv:hep-th/0509152`](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509152).

They set up a nice correspondence between some non-crystallographic
Coxeter groups and some crystallographic ones:

the H_2 Coxeter group and the A_4 Coxeter group,\
the H_3 Coxeter group and the D~6~ Coxeter group,\
the H_4 Coxeter group and the \mathrm{E}_8 Coxeter group.\

A Coxeter group is a finite group of linear transformations of R^n
that's generated by reflections. We say such a group is
"non-crystallographic" if it's not the symmetries of any lattice. The
ones listed above are closely tied to the number 5:

H_2 is the symmetry group of a regular
[pentagon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon).\
H_3 is the symmetry group of a regular
[dodecahedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron).\
H_4 is the symmetry group of a regular
[120-cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120-cell).\

Note these live in 2d, 3d and 4d space. Only in these dimensions are
there regular polytopes with 5-fold rotational symmetry! Their symmetry
groups are non-crystallographic, because no lattice can have 5-fold
rotational symmetry.

A Coxeter group is "crystallographic", or a "Weyl group", if it *is*
symmetries of a lattice. In particular:

A_4 is the symmetry group of a $4$-dimensional lattice also called A_4.\
D~6~ is the symmetry group of a $6$-dimensional lattice also called D~6~.\
\mathrm{E}_8 is the symmetry group of an $8$-dimensional lattice also called
\mathrm{E}_8.\

You can see precise descriptions of these lattices in
["Week 65"](#week65) - they're pretty simple.

Both crystallographic and noncrystallographic Coxeter groups are
described by Coxeter diagrams, as explained back in
["Week 62"](#week62). The H_2, H_3 and H_4 Coxeter diagrams look
like this:

      5
    o---o

      5
    o---o---o

      5
    o---o---o---o

The A_4, D~6~ and \mathrm{E}_8 Coxeter diagrams (usually called Dynkin
diagrams) have twice as many dots as their smaller partners H_2, H_3
and H_4:

            o---o---o---o

                    o
                    |
        o---o---o---o---o

                    o
                    |
                    o
                    | 
    o---o---o---o---o---o

I've drawn these in a slightly unorthodox way to show how they
"grow".

In every case, each dot in the diagram corresponds to one of the
reflections that generates the Coxeter group. The edges in the diagram
describe relations - you can read how in ["Week 62"](#week62).

All this is well-known stuff. But Fring and Korff investigate something
more esoteric. Each dot in the big diagram corresponds to 2 dots in its
smaller partner:

      5
    o---o                       o---o---o---o
    A   B                       B'  A"  B"  A'



                                        o C"
      5                                 |
    o---o---o               o---o---o---o---o
    A   B   C               C'  B'  A"  B"  A'


                                        o D"
                                        |
                                        o C"
      5                                 |
    o---o---o---o       o---o---o---o---o---o
    A   B   C   D       D'  C'  B'  A"  B"  A'

If we map each generator of the smaller group (say, the generator D in
H_4) to the product of the two corresponding generators in the bigger
one (say, D'D" in \mathrm{E}_8), we get a group homomorphism.

In fact, we get an *inclusion* of the smaller group in the bigger one!

This is just the starting point of Fring and Korff's work. Their real
goal is to show how certain exactly solvable physics problems associated
to crystallographic Coxeter groups can be generalized to these three
noncrystallographic ones. For this, they must develop more detailed
connections than those I've described. But I'm already happy just
pondering this small piece of their paper.

For example, what does the inclusion of H_2 in A_4 really look like?

It's actually quite beautiful. H_2 is the symmetry group of a regular
pentagon, including rotations and reflections. A_4 happens to be the
symmetry group of a $4$-simplex. If you draw a $4$-simplex in the plane, it
looks like a pentagram:

::: {align="center"}
![](240px-Complete_graph_K5.svg.png)
:::

So, any symmetry of the pentagon gives a symmetry of the $4$-simplex. So,
we get an inclusion of H_2 in A_4.

People often say that Penrose tilings arise from lattices in 4d space.
Maybe I'm finally starting to understand how! The A_4 lattice has a
bunch of $4$-simplices in it - but when we project these onto the plane
correctly, they give pentagrams. I'd be very happy if this were the
key.

What about the inclusion of H_3 in D~6~?

Here James Dolan helped me make a guess. H_3 is the symmetry group of a
regular dodecahedron, including rotations and reflections. D~6~ consists
of all linear transformations of R^6 generated by permuting the 6
coordinate axes and switching the signs of an even number of
coordinates. But a dodecahedron has 6 "axes" going between opposite
pentagons! If we arbitrarily orient all these axes, I believe any
rotation or reflection of the dodecahedron gives an element of D~6~. So,
we get an inclusion of H_3 in D~6~.

And finally, what about the inclusion of H_4 in \mathrm{E}_8?

H_4 is the symmetry group of the 120-cell, including rotations and
reflections. In 8 dimensions, you can get 240 equal-sized balls to touch
a central ball of the same size. \mathrm{E}_8 acts as symmetries of this
arrangement. There's a clever trick for grouping the 240 balls into 120
ordered pairs, which is explained by Fring and Korff and also by
Conway's "icosian" construction of \mathrm{E}_8 described at the end of my
talk on the number 8. Each element of H_4 gives a permutation of the
120 faces of the 120-cell - and thanks to that clever trick, this gives
a permutation of the 240 balls. This permutation actually comes from an
element of \mathrm{E}_8. So, we get an inclusion of H_4 in \mathrm{E}_8.

My last talk was on the number 24. Here I explained Euler's crazy
"proof" that

1 + 2 + 3 + ... = -1/12

and how this makes bosonic strings happy when they have 24 transverse
directions to wiggle around in. I also touched on the $24$-dimensional
Leech lattice and how this gives a version of bosonic string theory
whose symmetry group is the Monster: the largest sporadic finite simple
group.

A lot of the special properties of the number 24 are really properties
of the number 12 - and most of these come from the period-12 behavior of
modular forms. I explained this back in ["Week 125"](#week125). I
recently ran into these papers describing yet another curious property
of the number 12, also related to modular forms, but very easy to state:

8) Bjorn Poonen and Fernando Rodriguez-Villegas, Lattice polygons and
the number 12. Available at
`http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.43.2555`

9) John M. Burns and David O'Keeffe, Lattice polygons in the plane and
the number 12, Irish Math. Soc. Bulletin 57 (2006), 65-68. Also
available at `http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/ims/bull57/M5700.pdf`

Consider the lattice in the plane consisting of points with integer
coordinates. Draw a convex polygon whose vertices lie on this lattice.
Obviously, the *differences* of successive vertices also lie on the
lattice. We can create a new convex polygon with these differences as
vertices. This is called the "dual" polygon.

Say our original polygon is so small that the only lattice point in its
interior is (0,0). Then the same is true of its dual! Furthermore, the
dual of the dual is the original polygon!

But now for the cool part. Take a polygon of this sort, and add up the
number of lattice points on its boundary and the number of lattice
points on the boundary of its dual. The total is 12.

You can see an example in Figure 1 of the paper by Poonen and
Rodriguez-Villegas:

::: {align="center"}
![](lattice_polygons_and_the_number_12.jpg)
:::

Note that p_2 - p_1 = q_1 and so on. The first polygon has lattice 5
points on its boundary; the second, its dual, has 7. The total is 12.

I like how Poonen and Rodriguez-Villegas' paper uses this theorem as a
springboard for discussing a big question: what does it mean to
"explain" the appearance of the number 12 here? They write:

> Our reason for selecting this particular statement, besides the
> intriguing appearance of the number 12, is that its proofs display a
> surprisingly rich variety of methods, and at least some of them are
> symptomatic of connections between branches of mathematics that on the
> surface appear to have little to do with one another. The theorem
> (implicitly) and proofs 2 and 3 sketched below appear in Fulton's
> book on toric varieties. We will give our new proof 4, which uses
> modular forms instead, in full.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Addenda:** I thank Adam Glesser and David Speyer for catching
mistakes.

The only noncrystallographic Coxeter groups are the symmetry groups of
the 120-cell (H_4), the dodecahedron (H_3), and the regular $n$-gons
where n = 5,7,8,9,... The last list of groups is usually called I_n -
or better, I_2(n), so that the subscript denotes the number of dots in
the Dynkin diagram, as usual. But Fring and Korff use "H_2" as a
special name for I_2(5), and that's nice if you're focused on 5-fold
symmetry, because then H_2 forms a little series together with H_3 and
H_4.

If you examine Poonen and Rodriguez-Villegas' picture carefully,
you'll see a subtlety concerning the claim that the dual of the dual is
the original polygon. Apparently you need to count every boundary point
as a vertex! Read the papers for more precise details.
