Math is eternal, but I'll start with some news that may be
time-sensitive. Betelgeuse is shrinking!

Betelgeuse is that big red star in the shoulder of Orion. It's a red
supergiant, one of the largest stars known. It's only 20 times the mass
of the Sun, but it's about 1000 times as big across - about 5 times the
size of the Earth's orbit. For more of a sense of what that means,
watch this video. If you've got kids, have them watch it too:

2\) Hansie0Slim, Largest stars this side of the Milky Way,
`http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u70UBs7BWY8`

But, it's shrinking. These authors claim its radius has shrunk 15%
since 1993:

3\) C. H. Townes, E. H. Wishnow, D. D. S. Hale and B. Walp, A systematic
change with time in the size of Betelgeuse, The Astrophysical Journal
Letters 697 (2009), L127-L128.

That's about 1000 kilometers per hour!

Of course, it's a bit tricky to estimate the size of Betelgeuse -
besides being rather far, it's so diffuse that its surface isn't very
precisely defined. And it's a variable star, so maybe a little
shrinkage isn't a big deal. But the two known cycles governing its
oscillations have periods of one year and 6 years. So, the authors of
the above paper think this longer-term shrinkage has some other cause.

It could be just another cycle, with a longer period. But there's
another possibility that's a lot more exciting. Maybe Betelgeuse is
about to collapse and go supernova!

Indeed this seems likely in the long term, since that's the usual fate
of such massive stars. And the long term may not even be so long, since
Betelgeuse is about 8.5 million years old - quite old for stars this
big, which live fast and go out in a blaze of glory.

What if Betelgeuse went supernova? How would it affect the US economy,
and the next Presidential election? Could this be the Republican
party's best hope?

Sorry, I'm being a bit parochial... let me try that again. How would
it affect the insignificant inhabitants of a puny speck called Earth,
located about 500 or 600 light years away from Betelgeuse? According to
Brad Schaefer at Louisiana State University, it would be "brighter than
a million full moons", but it wouldn't hurt us - in part because of
the distance, and in part because we're not lined up with its pole.

(Perhaps just to build up the suspense, Schaefer added that Betelgeuse
could already have gone supernova, in which case we're just waiting for
its light to reach us.)

Actually, I have trouble believing that Betelgeuse gone supernova would
be brighter than a million full moons. First of all, the full moon is
1/449,000 times as bright as the Sun. So, "brighter than a million full
moons" is just an obscure way of saying "more than twice as bright as
the Sun."

Second, let's try the calculation ourselves. There are various kinds of
supernovae, with different luminosities. I guess Betelgeuse is most
likely to become a [type II
supernova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova). Such
supernovae show quite a bit of variation in their behavior. But anyway,
it seems they get to be 1 billion times as bright as the Sun, or maybe
at most - let's look at a worst-case scenario - 10 billion times as
bright. So, between 10^9^ and ten times that.

On the other hand, Betelgeuse is about 600 light years away, and there
are 63,239 astronomical units in a light year, so it's about

600 \times 63,000 ≅ 4 \times 10^7^

times as far away as the Sun - no point trying to be too precise here.
Brightness scales as one over distance squared, so supernova Betelgeuse
should look between

10^9^ / (4 \times 10^7^)^2 ≅ 7 \times 10^-7^

as bright as the Sun, and ten times that bright.

As I mentioned, the full Moon is about 2 \times 10^-6^ times as bright as the
Sun. So, supernova Betelgeuse should be roughly between 1/3 as bright as
the full Moon, and 3 times as bright. This is a rough calculation, but
I've done it a few different ways and gotten similar answers. So, it's
safe to say that "brighter than a million full moons" is a vast
exaggeration.

Whew.

It's worth recalling that not too long ago, a supernova exploded at a
roughly comparable distance from us, forming the "Local Bubble" - a
peanut-shaped region of hot thin gas about 300 light years across,
containing our Sun. The gas in the Local Bubble is about 1000 times less
dense than ordinary interstellar space, and vastly hotter.

:::

What do I mean by "not too long ago"? Well, nobody is sure, but back
in ["Week 144"](#week144) I reported a bunch of evidence for a
theory that the Local Bubble was formed just 340,000 years ago, when a
star called Geminga went supernova, perhaps 180 light years away.

Now I'm getting a sense that the situation is more complex. It seems
our Sun is near the boundary of the Local Bubble and another one, called
the "Loop I Bubble". This other bubble seems to have formed earlier -
perhaps 2 million years ago, at the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition,
when a bunch of ultraviolet-sensitive marine creatures mysteriously
died:

4\) NASA, Near-earth supernovas,
`http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/06jan_bubble.htm`

The Loop I Bubble may have been caused by a supernova in "Sco-Cen", a
cloud in the directions of Scorpius and Centaurus. It's about 450 light
years away now, but it used to be considerably closer.

In the last few million years, some wisps of interstellar gas have
drifted into the Local Bubble. Our solar system is immersed in one of
these filaments, charmingly dubbed the "local fluff". It's much
cooler than the hot gas of the Local Bubble: 7000 Kelvin instead of
roughly 1 million. It's also much denser - about 0.1 atoms per cubic
centimeter instead of 0.05 or so. But Sco-Cen is sending interstellar
cloudlets in our direction that are denser still, by a factor of 100.
These might actually have some effect on the Sun's magnetic field when
they reach us.

I'm sure we'll get a clearer story as time goes by. In 2003, NASA
launched a satellite called the Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma
Spectrometer, or CHIPS for short, to study this sort of thing:

5\) NASA/UC Berkeley, Overview of CHIPS Science,
`http://chips.ssl.berkeley.edu/science.html`

It sounds pretty interesting. Unfortunately the latest news on the CHIPS
homepage dates back to 2005, before they'd done much science. What's
up?

You can't do much about Betelgeuse. But you can do something about
mathematics! For example, if you're into categories or $n$-categories,
you can help out the nLab:

6\) nLab, `http://ncatlab.org/nlab`

The nLab is like the library, or laboratory, in the back room of the
n-Category Café. The nCafé is a place to chat: it's a blog. The nLab is
a place to work: it's a wiki. It's been operating since November 2008.
There's quite a lot there by now, but it's really just getting
started.

Check it out! You'll find explanations of many concepts, which you may
be able to improve, and the beginnings of some big projects, which you
may want to join.

So far the main contributors include Urs Schreiber, Mike Shulman, Toby
Bartels, Tim Porter, Ronnie Brown, Todd Trimble, David Roberts, Andrew
Stacey, Bruce Bartlett, Zoran Škoda, Eric Forgy and myself. Jim Dolan
recently joined in with a page on algebraic geometry for category
theorists - I'll say more about this someday. And like the nCafé,
technical aspects of the nLab are largely run by Jacques Distler - it
uses some wiki software called Instiki which he is helping develop.

Finally, a bit of actual math. Here's a paper by the fellow I'm
working with here in Paris, and a grad student of his:

7\) Paul-André Mélliès and Nicolas Tabareau, Free models of T-algebraic
theories computed as Kan extensions, available at
`http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00339331/fr/`

I really need to understand this for my work with Mike Stay.

In ["Week 200"](#week200) I talked about Lawvere's work on
algebraic theories; I'll assume you read that and pick up from there.
In its narrowest sense, an "algebraic theory" is a category with
finite products where every object is a product of copies of some fixed
object c. We use algebraic theories to describe various types of
mathematical gadgets: to be precise, any type of gadget that consists of
a set with a bunch of $n$-ary operations satisfying a bunch of purely
equational laws.

For any type of gadget like this, there's an algebraic theory C; I
explained how you get this back in ["Week 200"](#week200). If we
have a functor

F: C \to Set

that preserves finite products, then F(c) becomes a specific gadget of
the given type. Conversely, any specific gadget of the given type
determines a functor like this.

So, we define a "model" of the theory C to be a functor

F: C \to Set

that preserves finite products. But actually, this is just a model of C
in the world of sets! We could replace Set by any other category with
finite products, say X, and define a "model of the theory C in the
environment X" to be a functor

F: C \to X

that preserves finite products.

For example, if C is the theory of groups and X is Set, a model of C in
X is a group. If instead X is the category of topological spaces, a
model of C in X is a topological group. And so on. In general people
call a model of this particular theory C in any old X a "group object
in X".

But as you might fear, we want to understand more than a single model of
C in X. As category theorists, we want to understand the whole
*category* of models of C in X. This category, which I'll call
Mod(C,X), has:

-   functors F: C \to X that preserve finite products as its objects;
-   natural transformations between these as its morphisms.

For example, if C is the theory of groups and X is the category of
topological spaces, Mod(C,X) is the category of topological groups and
continuous homomorphisms.

So far I've just been reviewing at a fast pace. What happens next?
Well, there's always a forgetful functor

R: Mod(C,X) \to X

sending any model to its underlying object in X. But what we'd really
like is for R to have a left adjoint

L: X \to Mod(C,X)

sending any object of X to the free gadget on that object. Then we could
follow L by R to get a functor

RL: X \to X

called a "monad". One reason this would be great is that monads are
another popular way to study algebraic gadgets. I explained monads very
generally back in ["Week 89"](#week89), and said how to get them
from adjoint functors in ["Week 92"](#week92); in
["Week 257"](#week257) I gave some links to some great videos by
the Catsters explaining monads and what they're good for. So, I won't
say more about monads now: I'll just assume you love them. Given this,
you must be dying to know when the functor R has a left adjoint.

In fact it does whenever X has colimits that distribute over the finite
products! For example, it does when X = Set. And Mélliès and Tabareau
give a very nice modern explanation of this fact before generalizing the
heck out of it.

The key is to note that

R: Mod(C,X) \to X

is just an extreme case of forgetting *some* of the structure on an
algebraic gadget: namely, forgetting *all* of it. More generally,
suppose we have any map of algebraic theories

Q: B \to C

that is, a finite-product-preserving functor that sends the special
object b in B to the special object c in C. Then composition with Q
gives a functor

Q*: Mod(C,X) \to Mod(B,X)

For example, if B is the theory of groups and C is the theory of rings,
C is "bigger", so we get an inclusion

Q: B \to C

and then Q* is the functor that takes a ring object in X and forgets
some of its structure, leaving us a group object in X. But when B is is
the most boring algebraic theory in the world, the "theory of a bare
object", then Q* forgets everything: it's our forgetful functor

R: Mod(C,X) \to Mod(B,X) = X

So, we should ask quite generally when any functor like

Q*: Mod(C,X) \to Mod(B,X)

has a left adjoint. And, the answer is: it always does!

The proof uses a left Kan extension followed by what Mélliès and
Tabaraeu call a "miracle" - see page 5 of their paper. And, it's this
miracle they want to understand and generalize.

Here's the basic idea. If we write Hom(C,X) for the category with

-   arbitrary functors F: C \to X as its objects;
-   natural transformations between these as its morphisms

then composition with Q gives a functor

Hom(C,X) \to Hom(B,X)

and this has a left adjoint

Hom(B,X) \to Hom(C,X)

using a well-known trick called "Kan extension", or more precisely
"left Kan extension". Since Mod(B,X) is included in Hom(B,X), we can
compose this inclusion with the functor above:

Mod(B,X) \to Hom(B,X) \to Hom(C,X)

And now comes the miracle: this composite functor actually lands us in
Mod(C,X), which sits inside Hom(C,X). This gives us a functor

Mod(B,X) \to Mod(C,X)

which turns out to be what we wanted: the left adjoint of

Q*: Mod(C,X) \to Mod(B,X)

Kan extensions are a very general concept, so the hard part is
understanding and generalizing this miracle.

To do this Mélliès and Tabareau first generalize algebraic theories to
"T-algebraic theories" where T is any pseudomonad on Cat. I already
said that monads are a trick for studying very general algebraic
gadgets. Similarly, pseudomonads are a trick for studying very general
*categorified* algebraic gadgets, like "categories with finite
products" or "monoidal categories" or "braided monoidal categories"
or "symmetric monoidal categories".

Each of these types of categories allows us to define a type of
"theory":

-   monoidal categories let us define "PROs"
-   braided monoidal categories let us define "PROBs"
-   symmetric monoidal categories let us define "PROPs"
-   categories with finite products let us define "algebraic theories"

I explained all these, along with monads, here:

8\) John Baez, Universal algebra and diagrammatic reasoning, available
as `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/universal/`

Take my word for it: they're great. In particular, they're more
"quantum" in flavor than algebraic theories. So, we would like to
generalize Lawvere's original results to these other kinds of theories,
which are all examples of "T-algebraic theories". But, it's not
automatic! For example, it doesn't always work with PROPs.

A typical kind of algebraic gadget we could define with a PROP is a
"bialgebra". While there's always a free group on a set, there's not
usually a free bialgebra on a vector space! The problem is not the
category of vector spaces: it's that bialgebras have not only
"operations" like multiplication, but also "co-operations" like
comultiplication.

So, Mélliès and Tabareau have their work cut out for them. But they
tackle it very elegantly, using profunctors and a certain generalization
thereof: Richard Wood's concept of "proarrow equipment". This lets
them generalize the "miracle" to any situation where we have a little
T-algebraic theory sitting inside a bigger one

Q: B \to C

and the bigger one only has extra operations, not co-operations.

"Proarrow equipment" sounds pretty scary - it's taken me about a
decade to overcome my fear of it. So I'll stop my summary here, right
around page 12 of the paper - right when the fun is just getting
started!

Using this and other information, I checked that if Betelguese went
supernova, it would not be anywhere nearly as bright as "a million full
moons".

You can see one of my calculations above.

"TLE" refers to the "[two-line
element](http://www.mindspring.com/~n2wwd/html/body_tle_format.html)"
format for transmitting satellite locations.

The short version of the CHIPS story - which completely leaves out all
the fascinating twists and turns you'll find in that newspaper article
above - is that this satellite failed to detect the extreme ultraviolet
radiation ([EUV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUV)) that people expected
from the hot gas of the Local Bubble. It doesn't seem like a
malfunction. So, something we don't understand is going on!

Todd Trimble gave a snappy proof that the forgetful functor from
bialgebras to vector spaces has no left adjoint. If it did, it would
need to preserve limits. In particular, it would send the terminal
bialgebra to the terminal vector space. But the terminal bialgebra is
1-dimensional, while the terminal vector space is 0-dimensional - a
contradiction.

*The question you raise, "how can such a formulation lead to
computations?" doesn't bother me in the least! Throughout my whole
life as a mathematician, the possibility of making explicit, elegant
computations has always come out by itself, as a byproduct of a thorough
conceptual understanding of what was going on. Thus I never bothered
about whether what would come out would be suitable for this or that,
but just tried to understand - and it always turned out that
understanding was all that mattered.* - Grothendieck
