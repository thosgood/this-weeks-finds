# December 14, 2008 {#week273}

Today I'd like to talk about the history of the Earth, and then say a
bit about locally compact abelian groups. But first, a few more words
about Enceladus.

Last week we visited the geysers of Saturn's moon Enceladus.
Afterwards, George Musser pointed me to an article on this subject by
Carolyn Porco, leader of the imaging team for the Cassini-Huygens
mission - the team that's been taking the photos I showed you. It's a
great article, leading up to some intriguing theories about what powers
these geysers:

1) Carolyn Porco, Enceladus: secrets of Saturn's strangest moon,
Scientific American, November 2008, available at
`http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=enceladus-secrets`

And it's free online! - at least for now. I've criticized the
Scientific American before here, but if they keep coming out with
articles like this, I'll change my tune. For one thing, it's
well-written:

> There is obviously a tale writ on the countenance of this little moon
> that tells of dramatic events in its past, but its present, we were
> about to find out, is more stunning by far. In its excursion over the
> outskirts of the south polar terrain, Cassini's dust analyzer picked
> up tiny particles, apparently coming from the region of the tiger
> stripes. Two other instruments detected water vapor, and one of them
> delivered the signature of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane.
> Cassini had passed through a tenuous cloud.
>
> What is more, the thermal infrared imager sensed elevated temperatures
> along the fractures - possibly as high as 180 kelvins, well above the
> 70 kelvins that would be expected from simple heating by sunlight.
> These locales pump out an extraordinary 60 watts per square meter,
> many times more than the 2.5 watts per square meter of heat arising
> from Yellowstone's geothermal area. And smaller patches of surface,
> beyond the resolving power of the infrared instrument, could be even
> hotter.

For another, it tackles a fascinating mystery. Where does all this power
come from? The geysers near the south pole of Enceladus emit about 6
gigawatts of heat. Enceladus is too small to have that much radioactive
heating at its core - only about 0.3 gigawatts, probably. The rest must
come from tidal heating. This happens when stuff sloshes back and forth
in a changing gravitional field: friction converts this motion to heat.

So, what causes tides on Enceladus? It may be important that Enceladus
has a 2:1 resonance with Dione: it orbits Saturn twice for each orbit of
that larger moon. This sort of resonance is known to cause tidal
heating. For example, in ["Week 269"](#week269), I showed you how
Jupiter's moon Io is locked in resonances with Europa and Ganymede. The
resulting tidal heat powers its mighty volcanos.

Unfortunately, the resonance with Dione doesn't seem powerful enough to
produce the heat we see on Enceladus. Unless something funny is going
on, there should only be 0.1 gigawatts of tidal heating - not nearly
enough! At least that's what Porco estimated in 2006:

2) Carolyn Porco et al, Cassini observes the active south pole of
Enceladus, Science 311 (2006), 1393-1401.

So, we need to dream up a more complicated story.

Here's one: there could be a kind of slow cycle where the orbit of
Enceladus gets more eccentric, tidal heating increases, ice beneath its
surface melts, more sloshing water causes more tidal heating, and then
the release of heat energy damps its eccentric orbit, until it freezes
solid and the whole cycle starts over. We could be near the end of such
a cycle right now.

Here's another: maybe Enceladus has an sea of liquid water under the
frozen surface of its south pole. With enough water sloshing around,
there could be a lot more tidal heating than you'd naively guess...
and this heating, in turn, could keep the water liquid. The fun thing
about this second scenario is that a permanent liquid ocean on Enceladus
raises the possibility of life!

Nobody knows for sure what's going on - but Carolyn Porco examines the
options in a clear and engaging way. If you like celestial mechanics,
also try this paper:

(2007), 535-539. Also available at
`http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/wisdom/meyerwisdom1.pdf`

I wrote about Jack Wisdom's work back in ["Week 107"](#week107) -
it's fascinating stuff. He knows a lot about resonances. For related
work on the Jupiter-Saturn resonance, the Neptune-Pluto resonance, and
the math of continued fractions, also try the addenda to
["Week 222"](#week222).

Next I'd like to give you a quick trip through the Earth's history. In
["Week 196"](#week196) we looked back into the deep past, all the
way to the electroweak phase transition 10 picoseconds after the Big
Bang. On the other hand, here:

`http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/end.html`

you can zip forwards into the deep future - for example, 10^19^ years
from now, when the galaxies boil off, shooting dead stars into the the
vast night.

But now I'd like to zoom in closer to home and quickly tell the history
of the Earth, focusing on an aspect you may never have thought about.
You see, Kevin Kelly recently pointed me to this fascinating paper on
"mineral evolution":

5) Robert M. Hazen, Dominic Papineau, Wouter Bleeker, Robert T. Downs,
John M. Ferry, Timothy J. McCoy, Dmitri A. Sverjensky and Henxiong Yang,
Mineral evolution, American Mineralogist 91 (2008), 1693-1720.

Ever since it was formed, the number of different minerals on Earth has
kept going up --- and ever since *life* ran wild, it's soared! Some
examples are obvious: seashells become limestone, which gets squashed
into marble. Some are less so: for example, there wasn't much *clay*
before the advent of life.

Here's a timeline loosely taken from this paper:

-   **The era of planetary formation.**
    -   Primary chondrite minerals (> 4.56 billion years ago): *60
        species of mineral*.

        [Chondrites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrite) are stony
        meteorites that formed early in the history of the solar system.
        They're made of
        [chondrules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrule) ---
        millimeter-sized spheres of
        [olivine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine),
        [pyroxene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroxene) and other
        minerals --- together with nuggets called
        [CAIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium-aluminium-rich_inclusion)
        (calcium-aluminum rich inclusions) and other stuff. These
        chondrules began life as molten droplets back when the Sun was a
        [T Tauri star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri_star),
        heated only by gravitational collapse.

        :::

    -   Aqueous alteration, thermal alteration, and shocks form
        achondrites and iron meteorites (4.56 to 4.55 billion years
        ago): *250 species of mineral*.

        This is the era when the disk of dust circling the early Sun
        started forming lumps. As these lumps collided, they got bigger
        and bigger, eventually forming the asteroids and planets we see
        today. Some of these proto-planets melted, letting heavier
        metals sink to their core while lighter material stayed on top.
        But then some crashed into each other, shattering and forming
        new kinds of meteorites: iron-nickel meteorites, and stony
        meteorites called
        [achondrites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achondrite). Thanks
        to radioactive dating of these, scientists claim a shockingly
        precise knowledge of when all this happened: sometime between
        4.56 and 4.55 billion years ago.
-   **The era of crust and mantle reworking**.
    -   Igneous rock evolution (4.55 to 4 billion years ago): *350
        species of mineral*.

        The Earth's history is divided into four eons: the
        [Hadean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean),
        [Archean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean),
        [Proterozoic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic),
        [Phanerozoic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic). Back
        when I was a kid, the Cambrian era seemed really old - but
        that's just the start of the current eon, when multicellular
        life emerged: the Phanerozoic. We're digging much deeper now:
        the Phanerozoic will be *end* of today's story. The Hadean eon
        began with a bang: the event that formed the Moon around 4.55
        billion years ago! What made the moon? The current most popular
        explanation is the "giant impact theory" - sometimes called
        the Big Splat Theory. Dana Mackenzie spends a lot of time
        writing about math, but he's also written a book about this:

        6) Dana Mackenzie, The Big Splat, or How Our Moon Came To Be,
        Wiley, New York, 2003.

        The idea is that another planet formed in one of the "Lagrange
        points" of Earth's orbit - a stable spot 60 degrees ahead or
        behind the Earth:

        7) John Baez, Lagrange points,
        `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/lagrange.html`

        But when this planet reached about the mass of Mars, it would no
        longer be stable in this location. So, it gradually drifted
        toward Earth, and eventually smacked right into us! The impact
        was incredibly energetic, melting the Earth's entire crust and
        outer mantle. The iron core of this other planet sank into
        Earth's core, while about 2% of the outer part formed an
        orbiting ring of debris. Within a century, about half of this
        ring formed the Moon we know and love.

        It's an amazing story, but most of the evidence seems to
        support it. The early Moon is known to have been much closer to
        Earth than it is now - it's been receding ever since. For this
        and many other reasons, the giant impact theory is sufficiently
        solid that the hypothetical doomed planet that hit Earth has a
        name: Theia! You can even watch a simulation of it hitting
        Earth, produced by Robin Canup:

        8) Dana Mackenzie, The Big Splat (animation),
        `http://www.danamackenzie.com/big_splat_animation.htm`

        Let me quote Mackenzie on this:

        > The simulation shows the first twenty-four hours after the
        > giant impact. It begins with Theia about to strike the Earth.
        > After the impact, one hemisphere of the Earth is sheared off

        No rocks on Earth are known to survive from before 4.03 billion
        years ago, so the details of this time period are hotly debated.
        However, many igneous rocks, especially basalt, must have been
        formed at this time.

        [Basalt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt)
        :::

        Even after the surface cooled enough to form a crust, volcanoes
        continued to release steam, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. This
        led to what is called the Earth's "second atmosphere". The
        "first atmosphere" was mainly hydrogen and helium; the second
        was mainly carbon dioxide and water vapor, with some nitrogen
        but almost no oxygen. This second atmosphere had about 100 times
        as much gas as today's "third atmosphere"!

        As the Earth cooled, oceans formed, and much of the carbon
        dioxide dissolved into the seawater and later precipitated out
        as carbonates.

    -   Granitoid formation and the first cratons (4 to 3.2 billion
        years ago): *1000 species of mineral*.

        Between 4 and 3.8 billion years ago there was another scary
        time: the Late Heavy Bombardment. A lot of large craters on the
        Moon date to this period, so probably the Earth, Venus and Mars
        got hit too. Why so many impacts after a period of relative
        calm? One theory is that Jupiter and Saturn locked into their
        current 2:1 resonance at this time, causing a big shakedown in
        the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt. Wikipedia has a nice quick
        review of this and other theories:

        9) Wikipedia, Late heavy bombardment,
        `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_heavy_bombardment`

        This time also marked the rise of "cratons".
        [Cratons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cratons) are a bit like
        small early "plates" in the sense of [plate
        tectonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics):
        they're ancient tightly-knit pieces of the earth's crust and
        mantle, many of which survive today. While most cratons only
        finished forming 2.7 billion years ago, nearly all started
        growing earlier, in the Eoarchean era.

        Cratons are made largely of
        [granitoids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite#Mineralogy).
        Granitoids are more sophisticated igneous rocks than basalt.
        Modern [granite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite) is one of
        these. Granite is made in a variety of ways, for example by the
        remelting of sedimentary rock. Early granitoids were probably
        simpler.

        and [Mesoarchean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoarchean)
        eras, plate tectonics as we know it began. A key aspect of this
        process is the recycling of the Earth's crust through
        [subduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction): oceanic
        plates slide under continental plates and get pushed down into
        the [mantle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_mantle).
        Another feature is underwater volcanism and [hydrothermal
        activity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent).

    -   Anoxic biology leading up to photosynthesis (3.9 to 2.5 billion
        years ago): *1500 species of mineral*.

        The earliest hints of life include some [banded iron
        formations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation)
        that date back 3.85 billion years. The real fun starts with the
        rise of photosynthesis leading up to the Great Oxidation Event
        about 2.5 billion years ago - more on that later. But organisms
        from the domain [Archea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archea)
        can do well in a wide variety of extreme environments without
        oxygen, and as their name suggests, many of these organisms are
        very ancient. These organisms gave rise to an active [sulfur
        cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_cycle) and deposits
        of sulfate ores starting in the
        [Paleoarchean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoarchean) era.
        They also made the atmosophere increasingly rich in methane

        [Neoarchean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoarchean). So, life

        Catastrophe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_Catastrophe),
        photosynthesis put enough oxygen into the atmosphere to make it
        lethal to most organisms of the time. Luckily evolution found a
        way out of this impasse. The oyxgen-rich atmosphere in turn led
        to a wide variety of new minerals.

        anoxic life forms. For example, around 1.85 billion years ago,
        banded iron formations suddenly ceased. The next gigayear was
        rather static and dull --- if you're mainly interested in new
        minerals, that is. The term "intermediate ocean" means that
        during this period, the seawater contained a lot more oxygen
        than before, but still much less than today.

    -   Snowball Earth and the Neoproterozoic oxygenation events (1 to

        The

        era probably saw several [Snowball
        Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth) events:
        episodes of runaway glaciation during which most or all the
        Earth was covered with ice. Since ice reflects sunlight, making
        the Earth even colder, it's easy to guess how this runaway
        feedback might happen. The opposite sort of feedback is
        happening now, as melting ice makes the Earth darker and thus
        even warmer. The interesting questions are why this instability
        doesn't keep driving the Earth to extreme temperatures one way
        or another - and what stopped the Snowball Earth events back
        then!

        :::

        Here's a currently popular answer to the second question. Ice
        sheets slow down the weathering of rock. Weathering of rock is
        one of the main long-term processes that use up atmospheric
        carbon dioxide, by converting it into various carbonate
        minerals. On the other hand, even on an ice-covered Earth,
        volcanic activity would keep putting carbon dioxide into the
        atmosphere. So, eventually carbon dioxide would build up, and
        the greenhouse effect would warm things up again. This process
        might be very dramatic, with perhaps as much as 13% of the
        atmosphere being carbon dioxide (350 times what we see today),
        and temperatures soaring to 50 Celsius! But the details are
        still the subject of much controversy.

        At the end of these glacial cycles, it's believed that oxygen
        increased from 2% of the atmosphere to 15%. (Now it's 21%.)
        This may be why multi-celled oxygen-breathing organisms date
        back to this time. Others argue that the "freeze-fry" cycle
        imposed tremendous evolutionary pressure on life and led to the
        rise of multicellular organisms. Both these theories could be
        true.

        During the glacial cycles, few new minerals were formed - unless
        you count ice. Afterwards, surface rocks were weathered in new
        ways involving oxidation.

    -   Phanerozoic biomineralization (0.54 billion years ago to now):
        *over 4300 species of mineral*.

        beginning with the
        [Cambrian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian) 540 million
        years ago, marks the rise of of life as we know it. During this
        time, sea life has given rise to extensive deposits of
        biominerals such as

        soil](http://www.environment.ualberta.ca/SoilsERM/class.html#orders).

This is the end of our story - but of course the story isn't over.
We're now in the Anthropocene epoch of the Cenozoic era of the
Phanerozoic eon. New things are happening. Humans are boosting
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. If the temperature rises one more
degree, the Earth's temperature will be the hottest it's been in 1.35
million years, before the Ice Ages began. There's no telling when this
trend will stop. We're filling the oceans and land with plastic and
other debris. In millions of years, these may form new species of
minerals. Regardless, there will probably still be rocks - but we'll
either be gone or drastically changed.

Next: Pontryagin duality! Like last week's math topic, I needed to
learn more about this for my work on infinite-dimensional
representations of 2-groups. And like last week's math topic, it
involves a lot of analysis. But it also involves a lot of algebra and
category theory.

You may know about Fourier series, which lets you take a sufficiently
nice complex-valued function on the circle and write it like this:

f(x) = \sum_k g_k exp(ikx)

Here n ranges over all integers, so what you're really doing here is
taking a function on the circle:

f\colon S^1 \to C

and expressing it in terms of a function on the integers:

g\colon Z \to C

More precisely, any L^2 function on the circle can be expressed this
way for some L^2 function on the integers - and conversely. In fact, if
we normalize things right, the Fourier series gives a unitary
isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces L^2(S^1) and L^2(Z).

You may also know about the Fourier transform, which lets you take a
sufficiently nice complex-valued function on the real line and write it
like this:

f(x) = \int g(k) exp(ikx) dk

Here k also ranges over the real line, so what you're really doing is
taking a function on the line:

f\colon R \to C

and expressing it in terms of another function on the line:

g\colon R \to C

In fact, any L^2 function f\colon R \to C can be expressed this way for some
L^2 function g\colon R \to C. And if we normalize things right, the Fourier
transform is a unitary isomorphism from L^2(R) to itself.

Pontryagin duality is the grand generalization of these two examples!
Any locally compact Hausdorff abelian group A has a "dual" A*
consisting of all continuous homomorphisms from A to S^1. The dual is
again a locally compact Hausdorff abelian group - or "LCA group", for
short. When you take duals twice, you get back where you started. And
the Fourier transform gives a unitary isomorphism between the Hilbert
spaces L^2(A) and L^2(A*).

It's fun to take the Pontryagin duals of specific groups, or specific
classes of groups, and see what we get. We've already seen that the
dual of S^1 is Z, the dual of Z is S^1, and the dual of R is R. More
generally the dual of the $n$-dimensional torus is Z^n, and vice versa,
while the dual of R^n is isomorphic to R^n. What can we glean from
these examples?

Well, any discrete abelian group is an LCA group - a good example is
Z^n. So is any compact Hausdorff abelian group - a good example is the
n-dimensional torus. And there's a nice general theorem saying that the
dual of any group of the first kind is a group of the second kind, and
vice versa!

In particular, if we have an abelian group that's both compact and
discrete, its dual must be too. But the only abelian groups like this
are the *finite* abelian groups - products of finite cyclic groups Z/n.
So, this collection of groups is closed under Pontryagin duality!

In fact, it's easy to see that for any finite abelian group, A* is
isomorphic to A. But not canonically! To get a canonical isomorphism we
need to take duals twice: for any LCA group, we get a canonical
isomorphism between A and A**. This should remind you of duality for
finite-dimensional vector spaces - another famous collection of LCA
groups that's closed under Pontryagin duality.

You can take any collection of LCA groups, stare at it through the
looking-glass of Pontryagin duality, and see what it looks like. I've
mentioned a few examples so far:

> A is [compact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space) iff A* is
> [discrete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_group).
>
> A is [finite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set) iff A* is

> space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space)) iff A*
> is a [finite-dimensional vector

Here are some fancier ones:

> and [discrete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_group) iff A* is

>
> A is [second
> countable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-countable_space) iff
> A* is [second
> countable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-countable_space).

If you know more snappy results like this, tell me! I'm collecting them
- they're sort of addictive.

Because Pontryagin duality turns compact LCA groups into discrete ones -
and vice versa - we can use it to turn some topology questions into
algebra questions, and vice versa. After all, a discrete abelian group
has no more structure than an "abstract" abelian group - one without a
topology!

Sometimes this change of viewpoint helps, but sometimes it merely
reveals how hard a problem really is.

For example, here's an innocent-sounding question: what are the compact
path-connected LCA groups? The obvious example is the circle. More
generally, we could take any product of circles - even an *infinite*
product. Are there any others?

It turns out that this question cannot be settled by Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory together with the axiom of choice!

Here's why. An LCA group is compact and path-connected iff its dual is
a "Whitehead group". What's that? It's an abelian group A such any
short exact sequence of abelian groups like this splits:

0 \to Z \to B \to A \to 0

where Z is the integers and B is any abelian group.

We call this sort of short exact sequence an "extension of A by Z".
So, if you want to show off your sophistication, you can say that A is a
Whitehead group if "Ext(A,Z) = 0".

The obvious examples of Whitehead groups are free abelian groups.
Indeed, these are precisely the guys whose Pontryagin dual is a product
of circles! So the question is: are there any others? Or is every
Whitehead group a free abelian group?

This is a famous old problem, called the Whitehead problem:

10) Wikipedia, Whitehead problem,
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_problem`

In 1971, the logician Saharon Shelah showed the answer to this problem
was undecidable using the axioms of ZFC! This was one of the first
problems mathematicians really cared about that turned out to be
undecidable.

If you want an easy introduction to Pontryagin duality and the structure
of LCA groups, you can't beat this:

10) Sidney A. Morris, Pontryagin Duality and the Structure of Locally
Compact Abelian Groups, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 1977.

This classic treatment is still great, too:

14) Lev S. Pontrjagin, Topological Groups, Princeton University Press,
Princeton, 1939.

To dig deeper, you need to read this - it's a real mine of information:

15) E. Hewitt and K. A. Ross, Abstract Harmonic Analysis I, Springer,
Berlin, 1979.

This book has a lot of interesting newer results:

16) David L. Armacost, The Structure of Locally Compact Abelian Groups,
Dekker, New York, 1981.

In particular, this is where I learned about path-connected LCA groups
and the Whitehead problem.

I'd like to dedicate this issue of This Week's Finds to my father,
Peter Baez, who died yesterday around midnight at the age of 87. His
health had been failing for a long time, so this did not come as a
shock. It's a curious coincidence that I was already writing an issue
about minerals, since my dad majored in chemistry and returned to school
for a master's in soil science after serving in the Army in World War
II. After that he worked in the Blackfeet Nation in Browning Montana,
riding around in a jeep, digging up soil samples, and testing them back
at the lab for the Army Corps of Engineers. When he found "medicine
wheels" - stone circles laid down by the native Americans for ritual
reasons - he would report them to his friend the archeologist Tom Kehoe.
Later he moved to California, became an editor for the Forest Service,
and met my mother.

He got me interested in science at an early age because he was always
taking me to museums, bringing me books from the public library, and so
on. As a little kid, when I spilled something, he'd say "So you don't
believe in the law of gravity?" He liked to joke around. Whenever I
said an ungrammatical sentence, he'd tease me for it. "I'm not that
hungry." "What do you mean? You're not *how* hungry?"

I learned a lot of math, physics and chemistry from his 1947 edition of
the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics - an edition so old that it
listed "mesothorium" among the radioactive isotopes. He brought home
the book "From Frege to Gödel" - a sourcebook in mathematical logic -
because it was in the math section of the library and he misread
"Gödel" as "Googol": he knew I liked large numbers! I didn't
understand much of it, but it had a big effect on me.

I owe a lot to him.

**Addenda:** I thank Michael Barr, Kevin Buzzard and Mike Stay for some
interesting comments. Mike Stay pointed out an interesting book on how
humans may affect the future of mineral evolution:

in the Rocks?, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2009.

It's not 2009 yet, but the best books about the future are actually
published in the future. Here's a quote:
