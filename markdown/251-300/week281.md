# October 19, 2009 {#week281}

This week I'd like to finish my news report from the Corfu summer
school on quantum gravity. You'll hear how strings meet loops in BF
theory, and how the Poincaré 2-group gives a spin foam model that mimics
flat Minkowski spacetime.

But first: Timurid tiling patterns with 5-fold and 10-fold
quasisymmetry, and the astronomy pictures of the week!

If you listen to the news, you probably heard that NASA discovered an
enormous diffuse ring around Saturn. They did it using the Spitzer Space
Telescope, a satellite equipped with a telescope that detects infrared
light. In ["Week 243"](#week243) I showed you infrared light from
the first stars in the Universe, and in ["Week 257"](#week257) I
talked about magnesium and iron oxide dust emanating from the Red
Rectangle. Both of those were discovered using the Spitzer.

Here's what the new ring would look like if you could see it:

ring around Saturn, October 6, 2009,
`http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2009-150`

As you probably heard, it dwarfs all the visible rings, and it's tilted
relative to them. But even cooler is what the Spitzer Space Telescope
actually saw:

`http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/spitzer-20091007d.html`

It's an edge-on view of the new ring. It's fat: 20 Saturns thick. And
if you look carefully, you'll see that it has two layers, with a bit of
a gap in the middle. According to the scientists who discovered it, this
is consistent with its origin:

3) Anne Verbiscer, Michael Skrutskie, and Doug Hamilton, Saturn's
largest ring, Nature, October 7, 2009.

The point is that this ring surrounds the orbit of Saturn's moon
[Phoebe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_%28moon%29) - a
meteor-scarred hulk 100 kilometers across. While Phoebe looks like an
asteroid, it's probably an interloper from the outer Solar System,
because it's made of ice... but it's covered with a layer of dark
material.

::: {align="center"}
[![](phoebe.jpg)](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/05/050507095634.htm)
:::

The newly discovered ring seems to be made of this dark stuff, blasted
away from Phoebe by meteorite collisions. And its discoverers say the
double-layered structure is characteristic of rings formed this way from
moons with inclined orbits. (Jupiter also has some faint rings like
this, poetically known as the "[gossamer
rings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Jupiter#Origin_of_the_gossamer_rings)".)

What's really exciting about this new ring is that it explains one of
the big mysteries of the Solar System: the dark spot on Saturn's moon
[Iapetus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iapetus_%28moon%29)!

::: {align="center"}
[![](iapetus.jpg){width="500"}](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=2763)
:::

Iapetus is mostly icy, but one side is covered with dark stuff...
probably cyanides and carbon-rich minerals. Now it seems this stuff was
picked up from the newly discovered ring! It seems to have landed in
lumps - mainly on the leading side of Iapetus. You see, this moon is
locked in synchronous rotation with Saturn, just like our Moon always
shows the same face to Earth. So, one side plows through space and picks
up debris, while the other stays clean.

Here's a closeup of some lumps of dark stuff on Iapetus, taken by the
Cassini probe:

`http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08382`

NASA Photojournal, Inky stains on a frozen moon,
`http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08374`

As you can see, in this region of Iapetus the dark stuff is found at the
bottoms of craters. It could have formed these craters by impact, but
its presence could also gradually make these craters deeper: the dark
stuff should absors more sunlight and warm the nearby ice, making it
"sublimate": that is, turn into water vapor.

Because it's locked in synchronous rotation with Saturn, the "day" on
Iapetus is equal to one period of rotation, namely 79 of our Earth days.
So, it's probably the warmest place in the Saturnian system during the
daytime. Not very warm: just 113 kelvin on the ice. That's -160 °C! But
in the dark regions it should be about 138 kelvin. This extra warmth
should make more ice sublimate, making them even darker. It's been
estimated that over one billion years the very dark regions would lose
about 20 meters of ice to sublimation, while the light-colored regions
would lose only 10 centimeters, not even counting the ice transferred
from the dark regions.

If you want more, there's a great introduction to Saturn's rings in
this blog, followed by a nontechnical summary of the new paper on the
Phoebe ring:

5) Emily Lakdawalla, The Phoebe ring, The Planetary Society Blog,
October 14, 2009, `http://planetary.org/blog/article/00002165/`

As Lakdawalla points out, discovering a big ring was just the beginning:

> So far, it's a cool result but it's sort of like stamp collecting -
> we discovered a new X and described it, done. Where the paper gets
> really interesting is when the authors explore what happens to the
> particles in Phoebe's ring over time, something that you can model by
> writing down a few equations that describe the orbit of a particle,
> include Saturn, Phoebe, Iapetus, and Titan, include the masses,
> densities, and albedos of the particles, and the effects of incident
> sunlight.
>
> What happens to particles depends upon their size. The biggest chunks,
> several centimeters in size or larger, don't really migrate anywhere,
> sticking around near Phoebe's orbit until they smack into something -
> each other or Phoebe. The model simulation suggests that it would take
> more than the age of the solar system for half of the particles to be
> removed from the system by re-collision with Phoebe, so most of the
> biggest chunks are still out there somewhere in Phoebe's orbital
> space.
>
> What about smaller particles? The article says "re-radiation of

> them to spiral in towards Saturn with a characteristic timescale of
> 1.5 \times 10^5 r years, where r is the particle radius in micrometers.
> This force brings all centimetre-sized and smaller material to Iapetus
> and Titan unless mutual particle collisions occur first.... Most

> Iapetus, with smaller percentages striking Hyperion and Titan." This
> would be a slow process that has operated continuously since whenever
> Phoebe was captured into Saturn's orbit. There might have been bursts

[Next: tilings. The science fiction writer Greg Egan is also a
professional programmer, and he's written a remarkable collection of
Java applets, which you can see on his website. Here's the
latest:]{#tilings}

6) Greg Egan, Girih, `http://www.gregegan.net/APPLETS/32/32.html`

This program generates quasiperiodic tilings with approximate 10-fold
rotational symmetry using a method called "inflation". The idea of
inflation is to take a collection of tiles and repeatedly subdivide each
one into smaller tiles from the same collection. Egan's applet shows
the process of inflation at work: patterns zooming in endlessly!

::: {align="center"}
[![](girih_egan.jpg)](http://www.gregegan.net/APPLETS/32/32.html)
:::

Some of the math behind this is modern, but some goes back to the
[Timurids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_dynasty): the dynasty
founded by the famous conqueror
[Timur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur), also known as Tamerlane. By
1400, the Timurid empire was huge. It included most of central Asia,
Iran, and Afghanistan, as well as large parts of Pakistan, India,
Mesopotamia and the Caucasus. Its capital was the magical city of
[Samarkand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand).

The Timurids raised the art of tiling to its highest peak. Islamic
artists had already explored periodic tilings with most of the 17
mathematically possible "wallpaper groups" as symmetries - for more on
this, see my tour of the Alhambra in ["Week 267"](#week267). What
was left to do? Well, periodic tilings can have 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold,
or 6-fold rotational symmetry, but nothing else. Notice the gap? It's
the number 5! So that's what they tackled.

Precisely because you *can't* produce periodic tilings with 5-fold
rotational symmetry, it's a delightful artistic challenge to fool the
careless eye into thinking you've done just that.

In the 1970's, Penrose discovered quasiperiodic patterns with
approximate 5-fold symmetry - for example, patterns made of two tiles,
called "kites" and "darts":

-   kite: a convex quadrilateral with interior angles of 2\pi /5, 2\pi /5,
    2\pi /5 and 4\pi /5 as you march around it.
-   dart: a nonconvex quadrilateral with interior angles of 2\pi /5, \pi /5,
    6\pi /5 and \pi /5.

::: {align="center"}
[![](penrose_kite_dart.png)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling)
:::

The work of Penrose launched a huge investigation into quasiperiodic
tilings and quasicrystals. With their eyes opened, modern scientists saw
how fascinating the old Timurid tilings were:

7) Peter J. Lu and Paul J. Steinhardt, Decagonal and quasi-crystalline
tilings in medieval Islamic architecture, Science 315 (2007), 1106-1110.

Lu and Steinhardt described a set of 5 tiles which seem to underlie a
lot of Timurid designs:

-   a regular pentagon with five interior angles of 3\pi /5.
-   a regular decagon with ten interior angles of 4\pi /5.
-   a rhombus with interior angles of 2\pi /5, 3\pi /5, 2\pi /5, 3\pi /5.
-   an elongated hexagon with interior angles of 2\pi /5, 4\pi /5, 4\pi /5, 2\pi /5,
    4\pi /5, 4\pi /5.
-   a bow tie (non-convex hexagon) with interior angles of 2\pi /5, 2\pi /5,
    6\pi /5, 2\pi /5, 2\pi /5, 6\pi /5.

All the edges of all these tiles have the same length:

::: {align="center"}
[![](girih_tiles.png)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih_tiles)
:::

There are lots of ways to fit them together. The rhombus can be
subdivided into a kite and a dart, too!

Lu and Steinhardt call them "girih tiles". But "girih" actually
means "strapwork": the braided bands that decorate the tiles in a lot
of this art, as shown rather crudely in the picture above. Egan's
applet uses three of these tiles: the decagon, the elongated hexagon and
the bowtie. As you'll see on his webpage, each can be subdivided into
smaller decagons, hexagons and bowties. And that's how "inflation"
works.

Did the Timurid artists actually understand the process of inflation, or
the idea of a quasiperiodic tiling? Seeking clues, scholars have turned
to the Topkapi Scroll, a kind of "how-to manual" for tiling that
resides in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.

I would love to get my paws on this color reproduction:

and Ornament in Islamic Architecture, Getty Publications, 1996.

For now, the best substitute I've found is this beautiful article:

9) Peter R. Cromwell, The search for quasi-periodicity in Islamic
5-fold ornament, Math. Intelligencer 31 (2009), 36-56. Also available at

The Mathematical Intelligencer is a wonderful magazine put out by
Springer Verlag. It's recently become available online - and to my
shock, the above article is free! Springer doesn't give much away, so I
can't help but fear this is an oversight on their part, soon to be
corrected. So, grab a copy of this article *now*.

Cromwell argues that we shouldn't attribute too much modern
mathematical knowledge to the Timurid tile artists. But the really great
thing about this article is the detailed information on how some of
these tiling patterns are made - including lots of pictures. It repays
repeated study.

For an easy example, consider these regular decagons surrounded by
regular pentagons and funky hexagons of a different sort than those in
the girih tiles:

::: {align="center"}
![](tiling_cromwell_1.jpg)
:::

By replacing each decagon with a 10-pointed star, each pentagon with a
5-pointed star, and extending the lines outward in a clever way, he gets
this magnificent design - one of the most widespread star patterns in
Islamic art:

Here's a less mathematical and more historical introduction to the
Timurid tile artists, also with lots of nice pictures:

You should also check out Craig Kaplan's work. He's studied Kepler's
work on patterns built from decagons, and written software that
generates beautiful star patterns:

Another key player in this business is Eric Broug:

Check out the nice [photo

beautiful [screens](http://www.broug.com/product_screen.htm) and [other
products](http://www.broug.com/product_ot.htm). But I bought this
[book](http://www.broug.com/product_books.htm), which explains how to
make the patterns yourself:

16) Eric Broug, Islamic Geometric Patterns (book with CD-ROM), Thames
and Hudson, 2008.

Even if you don't have the skill or time to draw these patterns, the
book is worthwhile for the pictures and explanations.

I'll list a bunch more references below, for when I retire and get time
to devote myself more deeply to this subject. But now - on to Corfu!

Last time I said a bit about what I learned in Ashtekar and Rovelli's
courses. Now I'd like to talk about some other things I learned in
Corfu - some things I find even more tantalizing.

In ["Week 232"](#week232), I explained how gravity in 3d spacetime
automatically contains within it a theory of point particles, and how a
4d analogue of 3d gravity automatically contains within it a theory of
string-like objects. This 4d theory is called $BF$ theory. Like 3d
gravity, it describes a world where spacetime is flat. So, it's boring
compared to full-fledged 4d gravity - so boring that we can understand
it much better! In particular, unlike 4d gravity, we understand a lot
about what happens when you take quantum mechanics into account in 4d BF
theory.

But when you remove a surface from spacetime in 4d $BF$ theory, it springs
to life! In particular, the surface acts a bit like the worldsheet of a
string. It doesn't behave like the strings in ordinary string theory.
But Winston Fairbairn has been thinking about this a lot:

17) Winston J. Fairbairn and Alejandro Perez, Extended matter coupled
to $BF$ theory, Phys. Rev. D78:024013, 2008. Also available as
[`arXiv:0709.4235`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4235).

18) Winston J. Fairbairn, On gravitational defects, particles and
strings, JHEP 0809:126, 2008. Also available as
[`arXiv:0807.3188`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.3188).

19) Winston J. Fairbairn, Karim Noui and Francesco Sardelli, Canonical
analysis of algebraic string actions, available as
[`arXiv:0908.0953`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0953)

And it turns out that if we impose the constraints on $BF$ theory that
turn it into general relativity, we obtain the usual Nambu-Goto string,
where the action is the area! However, the last of the three papers
above shows there are some subtle differences.

I need to think about this a lot more. It was always my hope to
reconcile string theory and loop quantum gravity, and this could be the
way. Of course, reconciling two things that don't work doesn't
necessarily give one that does. A pessimist might say that combining
string theory and loop quantum gravity is like combining epicycles and
aether. But I'm optimistic. Something interesting is going on here.

In a different but possibly related direction, Aristide Baratin gave a
talk on recent work he's been doing with Derek Wise and Laurent
Freidel. You can get a feel for this work from this paper:

20) Aristide Baratin, Derek K. Wise, 2-Group representations for spin
foams, to appear in proceedings of the XXV Max Born Symposium: The
Planck Scale, Wroclaw, Poland. Also available as
[`arXiv:0910.1542`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.1542).

In ["Week 235"](#week235) I mentioned an amazing paper by Baratin
and Freidel called "Hidden quantum gravity in 4d Feynman diagrams:
emergence of spin foams". They described a spin foam model that acts
just like $4$-dimensional flat Minkowski spacetime: couple it to
interacting point particles, and you get the usual Feynman diagrams
described in a new way!

The big news is that this spin foam model comes from the representations
of a 2-group, instead of a group. Namely, the Poincaré 2-group. This is
a 2-group I invented which has Lorentz transformations as objects and
translations as endomorphisms of any object.

The Poincaré 2-group spin foam model was first studied by Crane,
Sheppeard and Yetter. Baratin, Freidel, Wise and I spent a long time
developing the theory of infinite-dimensional representations of
2-groups needed to make this model precise - see
["Week 274"](#week274) for more on all this. Now the details are
falling into place, and a beautiful picture is emerging.

I should admit that the paper by Baratin and Wise deals with the
Euclidean rather the Lorentzian version of this picture. I hope this is
merely because the representation theory of the "Euclidean 2-group" is
more tractable than that of the Poincaré 2-group. I hope everything
generalizes to the Lorentzian case.

A lot to think about.

Here's a database entry from the Alhambra:

Michael D. Hirschhorn emailed me to say that nearly 30 years ago, he and
David C. Hunt published a paper in the *Journal of Combinatorial Theory*
classifying all tilings of the plane by identical convex equilateral
pentagons. The most famous appears to be the "Hirschhorn medallion"
[Bob Jenkins](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/tile/pentagon.html) used it to
tile his bathroom:

Later Hirschhorn and Hunt extended their result to cover all
*non-*convex equilateral tilings, but this has never been published.

Presumably this page is based on Hirschhorn and Hunt's work:

the plane, available at `http://www.mathpuzzle.com/tilepent.html`
