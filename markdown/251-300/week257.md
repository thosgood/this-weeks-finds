# DATE {#week257}

Time flies! This week I'll finally finish saying what I did on my
summer vacation. After my trip to Oslo I stayed in London, or more
precisely Greenwich. While there, I talked with some good mathematicians
and physicists: in particular, Minhyong Kim, Ray Streater, Andreas
Döring and Chris Isham. I also went to a topology conference in
Sheffield... and Eugenia Cheng explained some cool stuff on the train
ride there. I want to tell you about all this before I forget.

Also, the Tale of Groupoidification has taken a shocking new turn: it's
now becoming available as a series of *videos*.

But first, some miscellaneous fun stuff on math and astronomy.

Math: if you haven't seen a sphere turn inside out, you've got to
watch this classic movie, now available for free online:

Astronomy: did you ever wonder where dust comes from? I'm not talking
about dust bunnies under your bed - I'm talking about the dust
cluttering our galaxy, which eventually clumps together to form planets
and... you and me!

These days most dust comes from aging stars called [asymptotic giant
branch](http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/AGB.html) stars:

::: {align="center"}

:::

The sun will eventually become one of these. The story goes like this:
first it'll keep burning until the hydrogen in its core is exhausted.
Then it'll cool and become a [red
giant](http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/R/redgiant.html).
Eventually [helium at the core will
ignite](http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/helium_flash.html),
and the Sun will heat up and [shrink
again](http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/H/horizontal_branch.html)...
but its core will then become cluttered with even heavier elements, so
it'll cool and expand once more, moving onto the "asymptotic giant
branch". At this point it'll have a layered structure: heavier
elements near the bottom, then a layer of helium, then hydrogen on the
top:

::: {align="center"}
[![](asymptotic_giant_branch_cutaway.gif)](http://www.noao.edu/outreach/press/pr03/sb0307.html)
:::

(A similar fate awaits any star between 0.6 and 10 solar masses, though
the details depend on the mass. For the more dramatic fate of heavier
stars, see ["Week 204"](#week204).)

Anyway: this layered structure is unstable, so asymptotic giant branch
stars pulse every 10 to 100 thousand years or so. And, they puff out
dust! Stellar wind then blows this dust out into space.

A great example is the Red Rectangle:

2) Rungs of the Red Rectangle, Astronomy picture of the day, May 13,
2004, `http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040513.html`

Here two stars 2300 light years from us are spinning around each other
while pumping out a huge torus of icy dust grains and hydrocarbon
molecules. It's not really shaped like a rectangle or X - it just looks
that way. The scene is about 1/3 of a light year across.

Ciska Markwick-Kemper is an expert on dust. She's an astrophysicist at
the University of Manchester. Together with some coauthors, she wrote a
paper about the Red Rectangle:

3) F. Markwick-Kemper, J. D. Green, E. Peeters, Spitzer detections of
new dust components in the outflow of the Red Rectangle, Astrophys. J.
628 (2005) L119-L122. Also available as
[`arXiv:astro-ph/0506473`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0506473).

They used the Spitzer Space Telescope - an infrared telescope on a
satellite in earth orbit - to find evidence of magnesium and iron oxides
in this dust cloud.

But, what made dust in the early Universe? It took about a billion years
after the Big Bang for asymptotic giant branch stars to form. But we
know there was a lot of dust even before then! We can see it in distant
galaxies lit up by enormous black holes called "quasars", which pump
out vast amounts of radiation as stuff falls into them.

Markwick-Kemper and coauthors have also tackled that question:

4) F. Markwick-Kemper, S. C. Gallagher, D. C. Hines and J. Bouwman,
Dust in the wind: crystalline silicates, corundum and periclase in PG
2112+059, Astrophys. J. 668 (2007), L107-L110. Also available as
[`arXiv:0710.2225`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0710.2225).

They used spectroscopy to identify various kinds of dust in a distant
galaxy: a magnesium silicate that geologists call "forsterite", a
magnesium oxide called "periclase", and aluminum oxide, otherwise
known as "corundum" - you may have seen it on sandpaper.

And, they hypothesize that these dust grains were formed in the hot wind
emanating from the quasar at this galaxy's core!

So, besides being made of star dust, as in the Joni Mitchell song, you
also may contain a bit of black hole dust.

Okay - now that we've got that settled, on to London!

Minhyong Kim is a friend I met back in 1986 when he was a grad student
at Yale. After dabbling in conformal field theory, he became a student
of Serge Lang and went into number theory. He recently moved to England
and started teaching at University College, London. I met him there this
summer, in front of the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, who had himself
mummified and stuck in a wooden cabinet near the school's entrance.

If you're not into number theory, maybe you should read this:

5) Minhyong Kim, Why everyone should know number theory, available at
`http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahmki/numbers.pdf`

Personally I never liked the subject until I realized it was a form of
*geometry*. For example, when we take an equation like this

x^2 + y^3 = 1

and look at the real solutions, we get a curve in the plane - a "real
curve". If we look at the complex solutions, we get something bigger.
People call it a "complex curve", because it's analogous to a real
curve. But topologically, it's 2-dimensional.

If we use polynomial equations with more variables, we get
higher-dimensional shapes called "algebraic varieties" - either real
or complex. Either way, we can study these shapes using geometry and
topology.

But in number theory, we might study the solutions of these equations in
some other number system - for example in Z/p, meaning the integers
modulo some prime p. At first glance there's no geometry involved
anymore. After all, there's just a *finite set* of solutions! However,
algebraic geometers have figured out how to apply ideas from geometry
and topology, mimicking tricks that work for the real and complex
numbers.

All this is very fun and mind-blowing - especially when we reach
Grothendieck's idea of [étale
topology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tale_cohomology), developed
around 1958. This is a way of studying "holes" in things like
algebraic varieties over finite fields. Amazingly, it gives results that
nicely match the results we get for the corresponding complex algebraic
varieties! That's part of what the [Weil
conjectures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weil_conjectures) say.

You can learn the details here:

6) J. S. Milne, Lectures on Étale Cohomology, available at
`http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/math732.html`

Anyway, I quizzed about Minhyong about one of the big mysteries that's
been puzzling me lately. I want to know why the integers resemble a
3-dimensional space - and how prime numbers give something like
"knots" in this space!

I made a small step toward explaining this back in
["Week 205"](#week205). There I sketched one of the basic ideas of
algebraic geometry: every commutative ring, for example the integers or
the integers modulo p, has a kind of space associated to it, called its
"spectrum". We can think of elements of the commutative ring as
functions on this space. I also explained why the process turning a
commutative ring into a space is "contravariant". This implies that
the obvious map from the integers to the integers modulo p

Z \to Z/p

gives rise to a map going *the other way* between spectra:

Spec(Z/p) \to Spec(Z)

In ["Week 218"](#week218) I reviewed an old argument saying that
Spec(Z) is analogous to the complex plane, and that Spec(Z/p) is
analogous to a point. From this viewpoint, primes gives something like
points in a plane.

However, from a different viewpoint, primes give something like circles
in a 3d space!

The easy thing to see is how Spec(Z/p) acts more like a circle than a
point. In particular, its "étale topology" resembles the topology of a
circle. Oversimplifying a bit, the reason is that just as the circle has
one $n$-fold cover for each integer n > 0, so too does Spec(Z/p). To get
the $n$-fold cover of the circle, you just wrap it around itself n times.
To get the $n$-fold cover of Spec(Z/p), we take the spectrum of the field
with p^n elements, which is called F~p^n~. Z/p sits inside this larger
field:

Z/p \to F~p^n~

so by the contravariance I mentioned, we get a map going the other way:

Spec(F~p^n~) \to Spec(Z/p)

which is our $n$-fold cover.

I should explain this in much more detail someday - it involves the
relation between étale cohomology, Galois theory and covering spaces. I
began tackling this in ["Week 213"](#week213), but I have a long
way to go.

Anyway, the basic idea here is that each prime p gives a "circle"
Spec(Z/p) sitting inside Spec(Z). But the really nonobvious part is that
according to étale cohomology, Spec(Z) is *3-dimensional* - and the
different circles corresponding to different primes are *linked!*

I've been fascinated by this ever since I heard about it, but I got
even more interested when I saw a draft of a paper by Kapranov and
Smirnov. I got it from Thomas Riepe, who got it from Yuri Manin.
There's a version on the web:

7) M. Kapranov and A. Smirnov, Cohomology determinants and reciprocity
laws: number field case, available at
`http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/triepe/F1.html`

It begins:

> The analogies between number fields and function fields have been a
> long-time source of inspiration in arithmetic. However, one of the
> most intriguing problems in this approach, namely the problem of the
> absolute point, is still far from being satisfactorialy understood.
> The scheme Spec(Z), the final object in the category of schemes, has
> dimension 1 with respect to the Zariski topology and at least 3 with
> respect to the etale topology. This has generated a long-standing
> desire to introduce a more mythical object P, the "absolute point",
> with a natural morphism X \to P given for any arithmetic scheme X
> \[...\]

Even though I don't fully understand this, I can tell something big is
afoot here. I think they're saying that because Spec(Z) is so big and
fancy from the viewpoint of étale topology, there should be some
mysterious kind of "point" that's much smaller than Spec(Z) - the
"absolute point".

Anyway, in this paper the authors explain how the [Legendre
symbol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_symbol) of primes is
analogous to the [linking
number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_number) of knots.

The Legendre symbol depends on two primes: it's 1 or -1 depending on
whether or not the first is a square modulo the second. The linking
number depends on two knots: it says how many times the first winds
around the second.

The linking number stays the same when you switch the two knots. The
Legendre symbol has a subtler symmetry when you switch the two primes:
this symmetry is called [quadratic
reciprocity](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/06/quadratic_reciprocity.html),
and it has lots of proofs, starting with a bunch by Gauss - all a bit
tricky.

I'd feel very happy if I truly understood why quadratic reciprocity
reduces to the symmetry of the linking number when we think of primes as
analogous to knots. Unfortunately, I'll need to think a lot more before
I really get the idea. I got into number theory late in life, so I'm
pretty slow at it.

This paper studies subtler ways in which primes can be "linked":

8) Masanori Morishita, Milnor invariants and Massey products for prime
numbers, Compositio Mathematica 140 (2004), 69-83.

You may know the [Borromean
rings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings), a design where no
two rings are linked in isolation, but all three are when taken
together. Here the linking numbers are zero, but the linking can be
detected by something called the "Massey triple product". Morishita
generalizes this to primes!

But I want to understand the basics...

The secret 3-dimensional nature of the integers and certain other
"rings of algebraic integers" seems to go back at least to the work of
Artin and Verdier:

9) Michael Artin and Jean-Louis Verdier, Seminar on étale cohomology of
number fields, Woods Hole, 1964.

You can see it clearly here, starting in section 2:

10) Barry Mazur, Notes on the étale cohomology of number fields,
Annales Scientifiques de l'Ecole Normale Superieure Ser. 4, 6 (1973),
521-552. Also available at
`http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=ASENS_1973_4_6_4_521_0`

By now, a big "dictionary" relating knots to primes has been developed
by Kapranov, Mazur, Morishita, and Reznikov. This seems like a readable
introduction:

11) Adam S. Sikora, Analogies between group actions on 3-manifolds and
number fields, available as
[`arXiv:math/0107210`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0107210).

I need to study it. These might also be good - I haven't looked at them
yet:

(2006), 40-63.

After giving a talk on 2-Hilbert spaces at University College, I went to
dinner with Minhyong and some folks including Ray Streater. Ray Streater
and Arthur Wightman wrote the book "PCT, Spin, Statistics and All
That". Like almost every mathematician who has seriously tried to
understand quantum field theory, I've learned a lot from this book. So,
it was fun meeting Streater, talking with him - and finding out he'd
once been made an honorary colonel of the US Army to get a free plane
trip to the Rochester Conference! This was a big important particle
physics conference, back in the good old days.

He also described Geoffrey Chew's Rochester conference talk on the
analytic S-matrix, given at the height of the [bootstrap
model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_model) fad. Wightman asked
Chew: why assume from the start that the S-matrix was analytic? Why not
try to derive it from simpler principles? Chew replied that "everything
in physics is smooth". Wightman asked about smooth functions that
aren't analytic. Chew thought a moment and replied that there weren't
any.

Ha-ha-ha...

What's the joke? Well, first of all, Wightman had already succeeded in
deriving the analyticity of the S-matrix from simpler principles.
Second, any good mathematician - but not necessarily every physicist,
like Chew - will know examples of smooth functions that aren't
analytic.

Anyway, Streater has just finished an interesting book on "lost
causes" in physics: ideas that sounded good, but never panned out. Of
course it's hard to know when a cause is truly lost. But a good
pragmatic definition of a lost cause in physics is a topic that
shouldn't be given as a thesis problem.

So, if you're a physics grad student and some professor wants you to
work on hidden variable theories, or octonionic quantum mechanics, or
deriving laws of physics from Fisher information, you'd better read
this:

13) Ray F. Streater, Lost Causes in and Beyond Physics, Springer
Verlag, Berlin, 2007.

(I like octonions - but I agree with Streater about not inflicting them
on physics grad students! Even though all my students are in the math
department, I still wouldn't want them working *mainly* on something
like that. There's a lot of more general, clearly useful stuff that
students should learn.)

I also spoke to Andreas Döring and Chris Isham about their work on topos
theory and quantum physics. Andreas Döring lives near Greenwich, while
Isham lives across the Thames in London proper. So, I talked to Döring a
couple times, and once we visited Isham at his house.

I mainly mention this because Isham is one of the gurus of quantum
gravity, profoundly interested in philosophy... so I was surprised, at
the end of our talk, when he showed me into a room with a huge rack of
computers hooked up to a bank of about 8 video monitors, and controls
reminiscent of an airplane cockpit.

It turned out to be his homemade flight simulator! He's been a hobbyist
electrical engineer for years - the kind of guy who loves nothing more
than a soldering iron in his hand. He'd just gotten a big 750-watt
power supply, since he'd blown out his previous one.

Anyway, he and Döring have just come out with a series of papers:

14) Andreas Döring and Christopher Isham, A topos foundation for
theories of physics: I. Formal languages for physics, available as
[`arXiv:quant-ph/0703060`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0703060).

II. Daseinisation and the liberation of quantum theory, available as
[`arXiv:quant-ph/0703062`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0703062).

III. The representation of physical quantities with arrows, available
as [`arXiv:quant-ph/0703064`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0703064).

IV. Categories of systems, available as
[`arXiv:quant-ph/0703066`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0703066).

Though they probably don't think of it this way, you can think of their
work as making precise Bohr's ideas on seeing the quantum world through
classical eyes. Instead of talking about all observables at once, they
consider collections of observables that you can measure simultaneously
without the uncertainty principle kicking in. These collections are
called "commutative subalgebras".

You can think of a commutative subalgebra as a classical snapshot of the
full quantum reality. Each snapshot only shows part of the reality. One
might show an electron's position; another might show it's momentum.

Some commutative subalgebras contain others, just like some open sets of
a topological space contain others. The analogy is a good one, except
there's no one commutative subalgebra that contains *all* the others.

Topos theory is a kind of "local" version of logic, but where the
concept of locality goes way beyond the ordinary notion from topology.
In topology, we say a property makes sense "locally" if it makes sense
for points in some particular open set. In the Döring-Isham setup, a
property makes sense "locally" if it makes sense "within a particular
classical snapshot of reality" - that is, relative to a particular
commutative subalgebra.

(Speaking of topology and its generalizations, this work on topoi and
physics is related to the "étale topology" idea I mentioned a while
back - but technically it's much simpler. The [étale
topology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topology) lets you
define a topos of
[sheaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topology#Sites_and_sheaves)
on a certain category. The Döring-Isham work just uses the topos of
[presheaves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presheaf_(category_theory)) on
the poset of commutative subalgebras. Trust me - while this may sound
scary, it's much easier.)

Döring and Isham set up a whole program for doing physics "within a
topos", based on existing ideas on how to do math in a topos. You can
do vast amounts of math inside any topos just as if you were in the
ordinary world of set theory - but using intuitionistic logic instead of
classical logic. Intuitionistic logic denies the principle of excluded
middle, namely:

::: {align="center"}
"For any statement P, either P is true or not(P) is true."
:::

In Döring and Isham's setup, if you pick a commutative subalgebra that
contains the position of an electron as one of its observables, it
can't contain the electron's momentum. That's because these
observables don't commute: you can't measure them both simultaneously.
So, working "locally" - that is, relative to this particular
subalgebra - the statement

::: {align="center"}
P = "the momentum of the electron is zero"
:::

is neither true nor false! It's just not defined.

Their work has inspired this very nice paper:

15) Chris Heunen and Bas Spitters, A topos for algebraic quantum
theory, available as [`arXiv:0709.4364.`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4364)

so let me explain that too.

I said you can do a lot of math inside a topos. In particular, you can
define an algebra of observables - or technically, a "C*-algebra".

By the Isham-Döring work I just sketched, any C*-algebra of observables
gives a topos. Heunen and Spitters show that the original C*-algebra
gives rise to a C*-algebra *in this topos*, which is *commutative* even
if the original one was noncommutative! That actually makes sense, since
in this setup each "local view" of the full quantum reality is
classical.

So, they get this sort of picture:

::: {align="center"}
[![](heunen_spitters.jpg)](http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4364)
:::

I've been taking the "ambient topos" to be the familiar category of
sets, but it could be something else.

What's really neat is that the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, saying
commutative C*-algebras are always algebras of continuous functions on
compact Hausdorff spaces, can be generalized to work within any topos.
So, we get a space *in our topos* such that observables of the
C*-algebra *in the topos* are just functions on this space.

I know this sounds technical if you're not into this stuff. But it's
really quite wonderful. It basically means this: using topos logic, we
can talk about a classical space of states for a quantum system!
However, this space typically has "no global points" - that's called
the "Kochen-Specker theorem". In other words, there's no overall
classical reality that matches all the classical snapshots.

As you can probably tell, category theory is gradually seeping into this
post, though I've been doing my best to keep it hidden. Now I want to
say what Eugenia Cheng explained on that train to Sheffield. But at this
point, I'll break down and assume you know some category theory - for
example, monads.

If you don't know about monads, never fear! I defined them in
["Week 89"](#week89), and studied them using string diagrams in
["Week 92"](#week92). Even better, Eugenia Cheng and Simon
Willerton have formed a little group called the Catsters - and under
this name, they've put some videos about monads and string diagrams
onto YouTube! This is a really great new use of technology. So, you
should also watch these:

16) The Catsters, Monads,
`http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=0E91279846EC843E`

The Catsters, Adjunctions,
`http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=54B49729E5102248`

The Catsters, String diagrams, monads and adjunctions,
`http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=50ABC4792BD0A086`

A very famous monad is the "free abelian group" monad

F\colon  \mathsf{Set} \to  \mathsf{Set}

which eats any set X and spits out the free abelian group on X, say
F(X). A guy in F(X) is just a formal linear combination of guys in X,
with integer coefficients.

Another famous monad is the "free monoid" monad

G\colon  \mathsf{Set} \to  \mathsf{Set}

This eats any set X and spits out the free monoid on X, namely G(X). A
guy in G(X) is just a formal product of guys in X.

Now, there's yet another famous monad, called the "free ring" monad,
which eats any set X and spits out the free ring on this set. But, it's
easy to see that this is just F(G(X))! After all, F(G(X)) consists of
formal linear combinations of formal products of guys in X. But that's
precisely what you find in the free ring on X.

But why is FG a monad? There's more to a monad than just a functor. A
monad is really a kind of *monoid* in the world of functors from our
category (here \mathsf{Set}) to itself. In particular, since F is a monad, it
comes with a natural transformation called a "multiplication":

m: FF => F

which sends formal linear combinations of formal linear combinations to
formal linear combinations, in the obvious way. Similarly, since G is a
monad, it comes with a natural transformation

n: GG => G

sending formal products of formal products to formal products. But how
does FG get to be a monad? For this, we need some natural transformation
from FGFG to FG!

There's an obvious thing to try, namely

                        mn 
    FGFG ======> FFGG ======> FG

where in the first step we switch G and F somehow, and in the second
step we use m and n. But, how do we do the first step?

We need a natural transformation

d: GF => FG

which sends formal products of formal linear combinations to formal
linear combinations of formal products. Such a thing obviously exists;
for example, it sends

(x + 2y)(x - 3z)

to

xx + 2yx - 3xz - 6yz

It's just the distributive law!

Quite generally, to make the composite of monads F and G into a new
monad FG, we need something that people call a "distributive law",
which is a natural transformation

d: GF => FG

This must satisfy some equations - but you can work out those yourself.
For example, you can demand that

           FdG          mn 
    FGFG ======> FFGG ======> FG

make FG into a monad, and see what that requires. (Besides the
"multiplication" in our monad, we also need the "unit", so you
should also think about that - I'm ignoring it here because it's less
sexy than the multiplication, but it's equally essential.)

However: all this becomes more fun with string diagrams! As the Catsters
explain, and I explained in ["Week 89"](#week89), the
multiplication m: FF => F can be drawn like this:

                         \               /
                          \             /
                          F\          F/
                            \         /
                             \       /
                              \     /
                               \   /
                                \ /
                                 |m               
                                 |
                                 |
                                 |
                                 |
                                 |
                                F|
                                 |

And, it has to satisfy the associative law, which says we get the same
answer either way when we multiply three things:

                 \      /        /        \        \      /
                  \    /        /          \        \    /
                  F\  /F      F/           F\       F\  /F
                    \/        /              \        \/
                    m\       /                \       /m 
                      \     /                  \     /
                      F\   /                    \   /F
                        \ /                      \ /
                         |m                       |m
                         |                        |
                         |            =           |
                         |                        |
                         |                        |
                         |                        |
                        F|                       F|
                         |                        |

The multiplication n: GG => G looks similar to m, and it too has to
satisfy the associative law.

How do we draw the distributive law d: FG => GF? Since it's a process
of switching two things, we draw it as a *braiding*:

                  F\   /G
                    \ /
                     / 
                    / \
                  G/   \F 

I hope you see how incredibly cool this is: the good old distributive
law is now a *braiding*, which pushes our diagrams into the third
dimension!

Given this, let's draw the multiplication for our would-be monad FG,
namely

           FdG          mn 
    FGFG ======> FFGG ======> FG

It looks like this:

                         \   \           /   /
                          \   \         /   /
                          F\  G\      F/   /G
                            \   \     /   /
                             \   \   /   /
                              \   \ /   /
                               \   /   /
                                \ / \ /
                                 |m  |n             
                                 |   |
                                 |   |
                                 |   |
                                 |   |
                                 |   |
                                F|   |G
                                 |   |

Now, we want *this* multiplication to be associative! So, we need to
draw an equation like this:

                 \      /        /        \        \      /
                  \    /        /          \        \    /
                   \  /        /            \        \  /
                    \/        /              \        \/
                     \       /                \       / 
                      \     /                  \     /
                       \   /                    \   /
                        \ /                      \ /
                         |                        |
                         |                        |
                         |            =           |
                         |                        |
                         |                        |
                         |                        |
                         |                        |
                         |                        | 

but with the strands *doubled*, as above - I'm too lazy to draw this
here. And then we need to find some nice conditions that make this
associative law true. Clearly we should use the associative laws for m
and n, but the "braiding" - the distributive law d: FG => GF - also
gets into the act.

I'll leave this as a pleasant exercise in string diagram manipulation.
If you get stuck, you can peek in the back of the book:

17) Wikipedia, Distibutive law between monads,
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_law_between_monads`

The two scary commutative rectangles on this page are the "nice
conditions" you need. They look nicer as string diagrams. One looks
like this:

             F\    G\   /G             F\    G/    /G
               \     \ /                 \   /    /
                \     |n                  \ /    /
                 \   /                     /    /
                  \ /             =       / \  /
                   /                     /    /
                  / \                   /    /  
                 /   \                  \   /  \
                /     \                  \ /    \
              G/       \F                 |n     \F
              /         \                G|       \

In words:

::: {align="center"}
"multiply two G's and slide the result over an F" =\
"slide both the G's over the F and then multiply them"
:::

If the pictures were made of actual string, this would be obvious!

The other condition is very similar. I'm too lazy to draw it, but it
says

::: {align="center"}
"multiply two F's and slide the result under a G" =\
"slide both the F's under a G and then multiply them"
:::

All this is very nice, and it goes back to a paper by Beck:

18) Jon Beck, Distributive laws, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 80,
Springer, Berlin, 1969, pp. 119-140.

This isn't what Eugenia explained to me, though - I already knew this
stuff. She started out by explaining something in a paper by Street:

19) Ross Street, The formal theory of monads, J. Pure Appl. Alg. 2
(1972), 149-168.

which is reviewed at the beginning here:

20) Steve Lack and Ross Street, The formal theory of monads II, J. Pure
Appl. Alg. 175 (2002), 243-265. Also available at
`http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/ftm2.html`

(Check out the cool string diagrams near the end!)

Street noted that we can talk about monads, not just in the 2-category
of categories, but in any 2-category. I actually explained monads at
this level of generality back in ["Week 89"](#week89). Indeed,
for any 2-category C, there's a 2-category Mnd(C) of monads in C.

And, he noted that a monad in Mnd(C) is a pair of monads in C related by
a distributive law!

That's already mindbogglingly beautiful. According to Eugenia, it's
practically the last sentence in Street's paper. But in her new work:

21) Eugenia Cheng, Iterated distributive laws, available as
[`arXiv:0710.1120`](http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.1120).

she goes a bit further: she considers monads in Mnd(Mnd(C)), and so on.
Here's the punchline, at least for today: she shows that a monad in
Mnd(Mnd(C)) is a triple of monads F, G, H related by distributive laws
satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation:

                 F\  G/   |H     F|  G\   /H
                   \ /    |       |    \ /
                    /     |       |     /
                   / \    |       |    / \
                  /   \   |       \   /   \
                 |     \ /         \ /     |
                 |      /     =     /      | 
                 |     / \         / \     |
                 |    /   \       /   \    |
                 \   /    |       |    \   /
                  \ /     |       |     \ /
                   /      |       |      /
                  / \     |       |     / \
                H/   \G   |F     H|   G/   \F

This is also just what you need to make the composite FGH into a monad!

By the way, the pathetic piece of ASCII art above is lifted from
["Week 1"](#week1), where I first explained the Yang-Baxter
equation. That was back in 1993. So, it's only taken me 14 years to
learn that you can derive this equation from considering monads in the
category of monads in the category of monads in a 2-category.

You may wonder if this counts as progress - but Eugenia studies lots of
*examples* of this sort of thing, so it's far from pointless.

Okay... finally, the Tale of Groupoidification. I'm a bit tired now,
so instead of telling you more of the tale, let me just say the big
news.

Starting this fall, James Dolan and I are running a seminar on geometric
representation theory, which will discuss:

-   Actions and representations of groups, especially symmetric groups
-   Hecke algebras and Hecke operators
-   Young diagrams
-   Schubert cells for flag varieties
-   q-deformation
-   Spans of groupoids and groupoidification

This is the Tale of Groupoidification in another guise.

Moreover, the Catsters have inspired me to make videos of this seminar!
You can already find some here, along with course notes and blog entries
where you can ask questions and talk about the material:

22) John Baez and James Dolan, Geometric representation theory seminar,
`http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2007/`

More will show up in due course. I hope you join the fun.

**Addenda:** I thank Eugenia Cheng for some corrections. Thomas Larsson

physics" online:

They show that any commutative C*-algebra A in a Grothendieck topos is
canonically isomorphic to the C*-algebra of continuous complex
functions on the compact, completely regular locale that is its maximal
spectrum (that is, the space of homomorphisms f\colon  A \to  C). Conversely,
they show any compact completely regular locale X gives a commutative
C*-algebra consisting of continuous complex functions on X. Even
better, they explain what all this stuff means.

Jordan Ellenberg sent me the following comments about knots and primes:

> 1.  In the viewpoint of Deninger, very badly oversimplified, Spec Z is
>     to be thought of not just as a 3-manifold but as a 3-manifold with
>     a flow, in which the primes are not just knots, but are precisely
>     the closed orbits of the flow!
> 2.  One thing to keep in mind about the analogy is that "the
>     complement of a knot or link in a 3-manifold" and "the
>     complement of a prime or composite integer in Spec Z" (which is
>     to say Spec Z\[1/N\]) are both "things which have fundamental
>     groups," thanks to Grothendieck in the latter case. And much of
>     the concrete part of the analogy (like the stuff about linking
>     numbers) follows from this fact.
> 3.  On a similar note, a recent paper of Dunfield and Thurston which I
>     like a lot, "Finite covers of random 3-manifolds," develops a
>     model of "random 3-manifold" and shows that the behavior of the
>     first homology of a random 3-manifold mod p is exactly the same as
>     the *predicted* behavior of the mod p class group of a random
>     number field under the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics. In other words,
>     you should not think of Spec Z or Spec Z\[1/N\] as being anything
>     like a *particular* 3-manifold -- better to think of the class of

foliated spaces, available as

3-manifolds, available as

On the *n*-Category Café, a number theorist named James corrected some
serious mistakes in the original version of this Week's Finds. Here are
his remarks on why Spec(Z) is 3-dimensional:

> answer to this question. As you wrote, there is a scientific answer in
