# June 20, 2008 {#week266}

I'm at this workshop now, and I want to talk about it:

1) Workshop on Categorical Groups, June 16-20, 2008, Universitat de
Barcelona, organized by Pilar Carrasco, Josep Elgueta, Joachim Kock and
Antonio Rodríguez Garzón,
`http://mat.uab.cat/~kock/crm/hocat/cat-groups/`

But first, the moon of the week - and a bit about that mysterious fellow
Pythagoras, and the Pythagorean tuning system.

Here's a picture of Jupiter's moon Io:

1) Io in True Color, Astronomy Picture of the Day,

It's yellow! - a world covered with sulfur spewed from volcanos,
burning hot inside from intense tidal interactions with Jupiter's
mighty gravitational field... but frigid at the surface.

Last week I talked about something called the "Pythagorean pentagram".
That's a cool name - but it's far from clear who first discovered this
entity, so I started feeling a bit guilty for using it, and I started
wondering what we actually know about Pythagoras or the mathematical
vegetarian cult he supposedly launched. Tim Silverman pointed me to a
scholarly book on the subject:

2) Walter Burkert, Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism, Harvard
U. Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1972.

It turns out we know very little about Pythagoras: a few grains of solid
fact, surrounded by a huge cloud of stories that grows larger and larger
as we move further and further away from the 6th century BC, when he
lived. This is especially true when it comes to his contributions to
mathematics. The infamous pseudohistorian Eric Temple Bell begins his
book "The Magic of Numbers" as follows:

> The hero of our story is Pythagoras. Born to immortality five hundred
> years before the Christian era began, this titanic spirit overshadows
> western civilization. In some respects he is more vividly alive today
> than he was in his mortal prime twenty-five centuries ago, when he
> deflected the momentum of prescientific history toward our own
> unimagined scientific and technological culture. Mystic, philosopher,
> experimental physicist, and mathematician of the first rank,
> Pythagoras dominated the thought of his age and foreshadowed the
> scientifi mysticisms of our own.

But, there's no solid evidence for any of this, except perhaps his
interest in mysticism and numerology and the incredible growth of his
legend as the centuries pass. We're not even sure he proved the
"Pythagorean theorem", much less all the other feats that have been
attributed to him. As Burkert explains:

> No other branch of history offers such temptations to conjectural
> reconstruction as does the history of mathematics. In mathematics,
> every detail has its fixed and unalterable place in a nexus of
> relations, so that it is often possible, on the basis of a brief and
> casual remark, to reconstruct a complicated theory. It is not
> surprising, then, that gap in the history of mathematics that was
> opened up by a critical study of the evidence about Pythagoras has
> been filled by a whole succession of conjectural supplements.

There's a new book out on Pythagoras:

3) Kitty Ferguson, The Music of Pythagoras: How an Ancient Brotherhood
Cracked the Code of the Universe and Lit the Path from Antiquity to
Outer Space, Walker and Company, 2008.

The subtitle is sensationalistic, exactly the sort of thing that would
make Burkert cringe. But the book is pretty good, and Ferguson is honest
about this: after asking "What do we know about Pythagoras?", she
lists everything we know in one short paragraph, and then emphasizes:
that's *all*.

He was born on the island of Samos sometime around 575 BC. He went to
Croton, a city in what is now southern Italy. He died around 495 BC. We
know a bit more - but not much.

It's much easier to learn about the Renaissance "neo-Pythagoreans".
This book is a lot of fun, though too romantic to be truly scholarly:

4) S. K. Heninger, Jr., Touches of Sweet Harmony: Pythagorean Cosmology
and Renaissance Poetics, The Huntington Library, San Marino, California,
1974.

It seems clear that the Renaissance neo-Pythagoreans, and even the Greek
Pythagoreans, and perhaps even old Pythagoras himself were much taken
with something called the tetractys:

                o

            o      o
          
         o      o     o

      o     o      o     o

To appreciate the tetractys, you have to temporarily throw out modern
scientific thinking and get yourself in the mood of magical thinking -
or "correlative cosmology", which tries to understand the universe by
setting up elaborate correspondences between this, that, and the other
thing. To the Pythagoreans, the four rows of the tetractys represented
the point, line, triangle and tetrahedron. But the "fourness" of the
tetractys also represented the four classical elements: earth, air,
water and fire. It's fun to compare these early groping attempts to
impose order on the universe to later, less intuitive but far more
predictively powerful schemes like the Periodic Table or the Standard
Model. So, let's take a look!

The Renaissance thinkers liked to organize the four elements using a
chain of analogies running from light to heavy:

fire : air :: air : water :: water : earth

Them also organized them in a diamond, like this:

                    FIRE
               
             hot           dry
     
        AIR                    EARTH
       
             wet          cold
                
                   WATER

Sometimes they even put a fifth element in the middle: the
"quintessence", or "aether", from which heavenly bodies were made.
And following Plato's Timaeus dialog, they set up an analogy like this:

    fire         tetrahedron 
    air          octahedron
    water        icosahedron 
    earth        cube
    quintessence dodecahedron

This is cute! Fire feels pointy and sharp like tetrahedra, while water
rolls like round icosahedra, and earth packs solidly like cubes.
Dodecahedra are different than all the rest, made of pentagons, just as
you might expect of "quintessence". And air... well, I've never
figured out what air has to do with octahedra. You win some, you lose
some - and in correlative cosmology, a discrepancy here and there
doesn't falsify your ideas.

The tetractys also took the Pythagoreans in other strange directions.
For example, who said this?

::: {align="center"}
"What you suppose is four is really ten..."
:::

A modern-day string theorist talking to Lee Smolin about the dimension
of spacetime? No! Around 150 AD, the rhetorician Lucian of Samosata
attributed this quote to Pythagoras, referring to the tetratkys and the
fact that it has 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 dots. This somehow led the
Pythagoreans to think the number 10 represented "perfection". If there
turn out to be 4 visible dimensions of spacetime together with 6
curled-up ones explaining the gauge group \mathrm{U}(1) \times \mathrm{SU}(2) \times \mathrm{SU}(3), maybe
they were right.

Pythagorean music theory is a bit more comprehensible: along with
astronomy, music is one of the first places where mathematical physics
made serious progress. The Greeks, and the Babylonians before them, knew
that nice-sounding intervals in music correspond to simple rational
numbers. For example, they knew that the octave corresponds to a ratio
of 2:1. We'd now call this a ratio of *frequencies*; one can get into
some interesting scholarly arguments about when and how well the Greeks
knew that sound was a *vibration*, but never mind - read Burkert's book
if you're interested.

Whatever these ratios meant, the Greeks also knew that a fifth
corresponds to a ratio of 3:2, and a fourth to 4:3.

By the way, if you don't know about musical intervals like "fourths"
and "fifths", don't feel bad. I won't explain them now, but you can
learn about them and hear them here:

5) Brian Capleton, Musical intervals,
`http://www.amarilli.co.uk/music/intervs.htm`

and then practice recognizing them:

6) Ricci Adams, Interval ear trainer,
`http://www.musictheory.net/trainers/html/id90_en.html`

If you nose around Capleton's website, you'll see he's quite a
Pythagorean mystic himself!

Anyway, at some moment, lost in history by now, people figured out that
the octave could be divided into a fourth and a fifth:

2/1 = 4/3 \times 3/2

And later, I suppose, they defined a whole tone to be the difference, or
really ratio, between a fifth and a fourth:

(3/2)/(4/3) = 9/8

So, when you go up one whole tone in the Pythagorean tuning system, the
higher note should vibrate 9/8 as fast as the lower one. If you try this
on a modern keyboard, it looks like after going up 6 whole tones you've
gone up an octave. But in fact if you buy the Pythagorean definition of
whole tone, 6 whole tones equals

(9/8)^6 = 531441 / 262144 \cong 2.027286530...

which is, umm, not quite 2!

Another way to put it is that if you go up 12 fifths, you've *almost*
gone up 7 octaves, but not quite: the so-called circle of fifths
doesn't quite close, since

(3/2)^12^ / 2^7 = 531441 / 524288 \cong 1.01264326...

This annoying little discrepancy is called the "Pythagorean comma".

This sort of discrepancy is an unavoidable fact of mathematics. Our ear
likes to hear frequency ratios that are nice simple rational numbers,
and we'd also like a scale where the notes are evenly spaced - but we
can't have both. Why? Because you can't divide an octave into equal
parts that are rational ratios of frequencies. Why? Because a nontrivial
nth root of 2 can never be rational.

So, irrational numbers are lurking in any attempt to create an equally
spaced (or as they say, "equal-tempered") tuning system.

You might imagine this pushed the Pythagoreans to confront irrational
numbers. This case has been made by the classicist Tannery, but Burkert
doesn't believe it: there's no written evidence suggesting it.

You could say the existence of irrational numbers is the root of all
evil in music. Indeed, the diminished fifth in an equal tempered scale
is called the "diabolus in musica", or "devil in music", and it has
a frequency ratio equal to the square root of 2.

Or, you could say that this built-in conflict is the spice of life! It
makes it impossible for harmony to be perfect and therefore dull.

Anyway, Pythagorean tuning is not equal-tempered: it's based on making
lots of fifths equal to exactly 3/2. So, all the frequency ratios are
fractions built from the numbers 2 and 3. But, some of them are nicer
than others:

    first = 1/1
    second = 9/8
    third = 81/64
    fourth = 4/3
    fifth = 3/2
    sixth = 27/16
    seventh = 243/128
    octave = 2/1

As you can see, the third, sixth and seventh are not very nice: they're
complicated fractions, so they don't sound great. They're all a bit
sharp compared to the following tuning system, which is a form of "just
intonation":

    first = 1/1                          
    second = 9/8                        
    third = 5/4                           
    fourth = 4/3                           
    fifth = 3/2
    sixth = 5/3
    seventh = 15/8
    octave = 2/1

Just intonation brings in fractions involving the number 5, which we
might call the "quintessence" of music: we need it to get a
nice-sounding third. A long and interesting tale could be told about
this tuning system - but not now. Instead, let's just see how the
third, sixth and seventh differ:

-   In just intonation the third is 5/4 = 1.25, but in Pythagorean
    tuning it's 81/64 = 1.265625. The Pythagorean system is about 1.25%
    sharp.
-   In just intonation the sixth is 5/3 = 1.6666.., but in Pythagorean
    tuning it's 81/64 = 1.6875. The Pythagorean system is about 0.7%
    sharp.
-   In just intonation the seventh is 15/8 = 1.875, but in Pythagorean
    tuning it's 243/128 = 1.8984375. The Pythagorean system is about
    1.25% sharp.

Here you can learn more about Pythagorean tuning, and hear it in action:

7) Margo Schulter, Pythagorean tuning and medieval polyphony,
`http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/harmony/pyth.html`

8) Reginald Bain, A Pythagorean tuning of the diatonic scale,
`http://www.music.sc.edu/fs/bain/atmi02/pst/index.html`

There's also a murky relation between Pythagorean tuning and something
called the "Platonic Lambda". This is a certain way of labelling the
edges of the tetractys by powers of 2 on one side, and powers of 3 on
the other:

               1

            2     3
           
         4           9

      8                 27

I can't help wanting to flesh it out like this, so going down and to
the left is multiplication by 2, while going down and to the right is
multiplication by 3:

                1

            2      3
          
         4      6     9

      8    12     18     27

So, I was pleased when in Heninger's book I saw the numbers on the
bottom row in a plate from a 1563 edition of "De Natura Rerum", a
commentary on Plato's Timaeus written by the Venerable Bede sometime
around 700 AD!

In this plate, the elements fire, air, water and earth are labelled by
the numbers 8, 12, 18 and 27. This makes the aforementioned analogies:

fire : air :: air : water :: water : earth

into strict mathematical proportions:

8 : 12 :: 12 : 18 :: 18 : 27

Cute! Of course it doesn't do much to help us understand fire, air,
earth and water. But, it goes to show how people have been struggling a
long time to find mathematical patterns in nature. Most of these
attempts don't work. Occasionally we get lucky... and over the
millennia, these scraps of luck added up to the impressive theories we
have today.

Next: the categorical groups workshop here in Barcelona!

A "categorical group", also called a "2-group", is a category
that's been equipped with structures mimicking those of a group: a
product, identity, and inverses, satisfying the usual laws either
"strictly" as equations or "weakly" as natural isomorphisms. Pretty
much anything people do with groups can also be done with 2-groups.
That's a lot of stuff - so there's a lot of scope for exploration!
There's a powerful group of algebraists in Spain engaged in this
exploration, so it makes sense to have this workshop here.

Let me say a little about some of the talks we've had so far. I'll
mainly give links, instead of explaining stuff in detail.

On Monday, I kicked off the proceedings with this talk:

9) John Baez, Classifying spaces for topological 2-groups,
`http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/barcelona/`

Just as we can try to classify principal bundles over some space with
any fixed group as gauge group, we can try to classify "principal
2-bundles" with a given "gauge 2-group". It's a famous old theorem
that for any topological group G, we can find a space BG such that
principal $G$-bundles over any mildly nice space X are classified by maps
from X to BG. (Homotopic maps correspond to isomorphic bundles.) A
similar result holds for topological 2-groups!

Indeed, Baas Bkstedt and Kro did something much more general for
topological *$2$-categories*:

10) Nils Baas, Marcel Bkstedt and Tore Kro, 2-Categorical K-theories,
available as
[`arXiv:math/0612549`](http://arXiv.org/abs/arXiv:math/0612549).

Just as a group is a category with one object and with all morphisms
being invertible, a 2-group is a $2$-category with one object and all
morphisms and $2$-morphisms invertible. But the 2-group case is worthy of
some special extra attention, so Danny Stevenson studied that with a
little help from me:

11) John Baez and Danny Stevenson, The classifying space of a
topological 2-group, available as
[arXiv/0801.3843](http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3843)

and that's what I talked about. If you're also interested in
classifying spaces of $2$-categories that aren't topological, just
"discrete", you should try these:

On Monday afternoon, Bruce Bartlett spoke on a geometric way to
understand representations and "2-representations" of ordinary finite
groups. You can see his talk here, and also a version which has less
material, explained in a more elementary way:

15) Bruce Bartlett, The geometry of unitary 2-representations of finite
groups and their 2-characters, talk at the Categorical Groups workshop
in Barcelona, June 16, 2008, available at
`http://brucebartlett.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/research/Barcelona.pdf`

Bruce Bartlett, The geometry of 2-representations of finite groups, talk
at the Max Kelly Conference, Cape Town, 2008, available at
`http://brucebartlett.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/research/MaxKellyTalk.pdf`

Both talks are based on this paper:

16) Bruce Bartlett, The geometry of unitary 2-representations of finite
groups and their 2-characters, draft available at
`http://brucebartlett.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/research/Max%20Kelly%20Proceedings.pdf`

The first big idea here is that the category of representations of a
finite group G is equivalent to some category where an object X is a
complex manifold on which G acts, equipped with an invariant hermitian
metric and an equivariant \mathrm{U}(1) bundle. A morphism from X to Y in this
category is not just the obvious sort of map; instead, it's diagram of
maps shaped like this:

                         S
                        / \
                       /   \
                     F/     \G
                     /       \
                    v         v 
                   X           Y

This is called a "span". So, we're seeing a very nice extension of
the Tale of Groupoidification, which began in
["Week 247"](#week247) and continued up to
["Week 257"](#week257), when it jumped over to my seminar.

But Bruce doesn't stop here! He then *categorifies* this whole story,
replacing representations of G on Hilbert spaces by representations on
2-Hilbert spaces, and replacing \mathrm{U}(1) bundles by \mathrm{U}(1) gerbes. This is
quite impressive, with nice applications to a topological quantum field
theory called the Dijkgraaf-Witten model.

Next, to handle the TQFT called Chern-Simons theory, Bruce plans to
replace the finite group G by a compact Lie group. Another, stranger
direction he could go is to replace G by a finite 2-group. Then he'd
make contact with the categorified Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT studied in
these papers:

avilable as
[`arXiv:math/0608484`](http://arXiv.org/abs/arXiv:math/0608484).

As the last paper explains, we can also think of this TQFT as a field
theory where the "field" on a spacetime X is a map

f\colon X \to BG

where BG is the classifying space of the 2-group G.

Given all this, it's natural to contemplate a further generalization of
Bruce's work where G is a Lie 2-group. Unfortunately, Lie 2-groups
don't have many representations on 2-Hilbert space of the sort I've
secretly been talking about so far: that is, finite-dimensional ones.

So we may, perhaps, need to ponder representations of Lie 2-groups on
infinite-dimensional 2-Hilbert spaces.

Luckily, that's just what Derek Wise spoke about on Wednesday morning!
His talk also included some pictures with intriguing relations to the
pictures in Bruce's talk. You can see the slides here:

19) Derek Wise, Representations of 2-groups on higher Hilbert spaces,
[http://math.ucdavis.edu/\~derek/talks/barcelona2008.pdf](http://math.ucdavis.edu/~derek/talks/barcelona2008.pdf%0A)

They make a nice introduction to a paper he's writing with Aristide
Baratin, Laurent Freidel and myself. Our work uses ideas like measurable
fields of Hilbert spaces, which are already important for understanding
infinite-dimensional unitary group representations. But if you're less
fond of analysis, jump straight to pages 20, 23 and 25, where he gives a
geometrical interpretation of these infinite-dimensional
representations, along with the intertwining operators between them...
and the "2-intertwining operators" between *those*.

This work relies heavily on the work of Crane, Sheppeard and Yetter,
cited in ["Week 210"](#week210) - so check out that, too!

There's much more to say, but I'm running out of steam, so I'll just
mention a few more talks: Enrico Vitale's talk on categorified
homological algebra, and the talks by David Roberts and Aurora del Ro on
the fundamental 2-group of a topological space.

To set these in their proper perspective, it's good to recall the
periodic table of $n$-categories, mentioned in ["Week 49"](#week49):

                       k-tuply monoidal $n$-categories 

                  n = 0           n = 1             n = 2

    k = 0         sets          categories         $2$-categories

    k = 1        monoids         monoidal           monoidal
                                categories        $2$-categories

    k = 2       commutative      braided            braided
                 monoids         monoidal           monoidal
                                categories        $2$-categories 

    k = 3         " "           symmetric           sylleptic
                                 monoidal           monoidal 
                                categories        $2$-categories  

    k = 4         " "             " "               symmetric
                                                    monoidal
                                                  $2$-categories

    k = 5         " "             " "                "  "

The idea here is that an (n+k)-category with only one j-morphism for j
< k acts like an $n$-category with extra bells and whistles: a "k-tuply
monoidal $n$-category". This idea has not been fully established, and
there are some problems with naive formulations of it, but it's bound
to be right when properly understood, and it's useful for anyone trying
to understand the big picture of mathematics.

Now, an $n$-category with everything invertible is called an
"n-groupoid". Such a thing is believed to be essentially the same as a
"homotopy $n$-type", meaning a nice space, like a CW complex, with
vanishing homotopy groups above the $n$th - where we count homotopy
equivalent spaces as the same. If we accept this, the $n$-groupoid version
of the Periodic Table can be understood using homotopy theory. It looks
like this:

                       k-tuply groupal $n$-groupoids 

                  n = 0           n = 1             n = 2

    k = 0         sets           groupoids        2-groupoids

    k = 1        groups          2-groups          3-groups  
                               
    k = 2       abelian          braided           braided

Most of this workshop has focused on 2-groups. But abelian groups are
especially interesting and nice, and there's a huge branch of math
called "homological algebra" that studies categories similar to the
category of abelian groups. These are called "abelian categories". In
an abelian category, you've got direct sums, kernels, cokernels, exact
sequences, chain complexes and so on - all things you're used to in the
category of abelian groups!

Can we categorify all this stuff? Yes - and that's what Enrico Vitale
is busy doing! He started by telling us how all these ideas generalize
from abelian groups to symmetric 2-groups, and how they change.

For example, besides the "kernel" and "cokernel", we also need extra
concepts. The reason is that the kernel of a homomorphism says if the
homomorphism is one-to-one, while its cokernel says if it's onto.
Functions can be nice in two basic ways: they can be one-to-one, or
onto. But because categories have an extra level, functors between them
can be nice in *three* ways, called "faithful", "full" and
"essentially surjective". So, we need more than just the kernel and
cokernel to say what's going on. We also need the "pip" and
"copip".

The concepts of exact sequence and chain complex get subtler, too. You
can read about these things here:

By generalizing properties of the category of abelian groups, people
invented the concept of "abelian category". Similarly, Vitale told us
a definition of "2-abelian $2$-category", obtained by generalizing
properties of the $2$-category of symmetric 2-groups. I believe this is
discussed here:

Mathieu Dupont is defending his dissertation on June 30th. I hope he
puts it on the arXiv after that. (He did!)

All this stuff gets even more elaborate as we move to $n$-groups for
higher n. To some extent this is the subject of homotopy theory, but one
also wants a more explicitly algebraic approach. See for example:

23) Giuseppe Metere: The ziqqurath of exact sequences of $n$-groupoids,
Ph.D. Thesis, Universit di Milano, 2008. Also available at
[`arXiv:0802.0800`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0802.0800).

The relation between 2-groups and topology is made explicit using the
concept of "fundamental 2-group". Just as every space equipped with a
basepoint has a fundamental group, it has a fundamental 2-group. And for
a homotopy 2-type, this 2-group captures *everything* about the space -
at least if we count homotopy equivalent spaces as the same.

David Roberts prepared an excellent talk about the fundamental 2-group
of a space for this workshop. Unfortunately, he was unable to come.
Luckily, you can still see his talk:

24) David Roberts, Fundamental 2-groups and 2-covering spaces,
`http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/06/fundamental_2groups_and_2cover.html`

The basic principle of Galois theory says that covering spaces of a
connected space are classified by subgroups of its fundamental group.
Here Roberts explains how "2-covering spaces" of a connected space are
classified by "sub-2-groups" of its fundamental 2-group!

Aurora del Río spoke on fundamental 2-groups and their application to
K-theory. Whenever we have a fibration of pointed spaces

F \to E \to B

we get a long exact sequence of homotopy groups

... \to \pi_n(F) \to \pi_n(E) \to \pi_n(B) \to \pi _{n-1}(F) \to ...

This is a standard tool in algebraic topology; I sketched how it works
in ["Week 151"](#week151).

Now, the $n$th homotopy group of a space X, written \pi_n(X), is just the
fundamental group of the $(n-1)$-fold loop space of X. So, the Spanish
categorical group experts define the $n$th "homotopy 2-group" of a space
X to be the fundamental 2-group of an iterated loop space of X. And, it
turns out that any fibration of spaces gives a long exact sequence of
homotopy 2-groups!

I was surprised by this, but in retrospect I shouldn't have been. Any
fibration gives a "long exact sequence of iterated loop spaces":

... \to L^nF \to L^n E \to L^n B \to L^n-1^F \to ...

So, as soon as we have a definition of "fundamental $n$-groupoids" and
long exact sequences of $n$-groupoids, and can show that taking the
fundamental $n$-groupoid preserves exactness, we can get a long exact
sequence of fundamental $n$-groupoids. If we simply define a fundamental
n-groupoid to *be* a homotopy $n$-type, this should not be hard.

But this was just the warmup for Aurora's talk, which was about
K-theory. Quillen set up modern algebraic K-theory by defining the
K-groups of a ring R to be the homotopy groups of a certain space called
B\mathrm{GL}(R)^+^. In here talk, Aurora defined the K-2-groups of a ring in the
same way, but using homotopy 2-groups! And then she went ahead and
studied them...

The slides for Aurora's talk are - as for many of the talks - available

**Addenda:** Writing the above stuff caused me to miss Behrang Noohi's
talk on using diagrams called "butterflies" to efficiently describe
weak homomorphisms between strict 2-groups (in the guise of crossed
modules). Luckily Tim Porter summarized it at the $n$-Category Café:

27) Timothy Porter, Behrang Noohi on butterflies and weak morphisms
between 2-groups, available at
`http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/06/behrang_noohi_on_butterflies_a.html`

For more details, you can't beat the original paper:

28) Behrang Noohi, On weak maps between 2-groups, available as
[`arXiv:math/0506313`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0506313).

Also at the $n$-Category Café, Bruce Bartlett discussed Tim Porter's
talk at the categorical groups workshop:

29) Bruce Bartlett, Tim Porter on formal homotopy quantum field
theories and 2-groups, available at
`http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/06/tim_porter_on_formal_homotopy.html`

Actually Porter gave two talks. The first was an introduction to
simplicial methods and crossed complexes, but Bartlett didn't summarize
that, and no slides are available. So for that, you should get ahold of
the following free book:

30) Timothy Porter, The Crossed Menagerie: an Introduction to Crossed
Gadgetry and Cohomology in Algebra and Topology, available at
`http://www.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/~tporter/menagerie.pdf`

and (harder) this review article highly recommended by Porter:

31) E. Curtis, Simplicial homotopy theory, Adv. Math. 6 (1971),
107-209.

The second talk by Porter, the one Bartlett blogged about, can be found
at the workshop's website:

32) Timothy Porter, Formal homotopy quantum field theories and
2-groups, available at
`http://mat.uab.cat/~kock/crm/hocat/cat-groups/slides/Porter.pdf`

This talk covered the papers by Martins, Porter and Turaev mentioned
above.

I apologize to everyone whose talks I have not mentioned!
