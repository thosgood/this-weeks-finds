Enough nebulae! Today's astronomy picture is Saturn's moon Titan,
photographed by the Cassini probe. Red and green represent methane
absorption bands, while blue represents ultraviolet. Note the incredibly
deep atmosphere --- hundreds of kilometers deep. That's because Titan
has a dense atmosphere but not much gravity. The pale feature in the
center here is called Xanadu.

If you fell into Titan's atmosphere, here's what you'd see. Unlike
the previous picture, this is in natural colors, taken by the Cassini
probe on March 31st, 2005 from a distance of just 9,500 kilometers:

The orange stuff is hydrocarbon "smog", perhaps made of chemicals
called [tholins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tholin) which I don't
really understand. When you got further down the atmosphere would be so
thick, and the gravity so low, that you could fly through it by flapping
wings attached to your arms. Unfortunately the atmosphere would be very
cold, and unbreathable: mostly nitrogen, with a little methane and
ethane. (I wrote about the hydrocarbon rain on Titan back in
["Week 160"](#week160), and showed you the first pictures of its
lakes in ["Week 210"](#week210).)

Astronomy is great, but today I want to talk about group theory. As you
may have heard, John Thompson and Jacques Tits won the 2008 Abel prize
for their work on groups:

If you want a fun, nontechnical book that gives a good taste of the sort
of things Thompson thought about, try this:

4) Marcus du Sautoy, Symmetry: a Journey into the Patterns of Nature,
HarperCollins, 2008.

Mathematicians will enjoy this book for its many anecdotes about the
heroes of symmetry, from Pythagoras to Thompson and other modern group
theorists. Nonmathematicians will learn a lot about group theory in a
fun easy way.

As a PhD student working under Saunders Mac Lane, Thompson began his
career with a bang, by solving a 60-year-old conjecture posed by the
famous group theorist Frobenius.

But, he's mainly famous for helping prove an even harder theorem
that's even simpler to state - one of those precious nuggets of
knowledge that mathematicians fight so hard to establish:

::: {align="center"}
"Every finite group with an odd number of elements is solvable."
:::

We say a group is "solvable" if it can be built out of abelian groups
in finitely many stages: the group at each stage mod the group at the
previous stage must be abelian. The term "solvable" comes from Galois
theory, since we can solve a polynomial equation using radicals iff its
Galois group is solvable.

Way back in 1911, Burnside conjectured that every finite group with an
odd number of elements is solvable. John Thompson and Walter Feit proved
this in 1963. Their proof took all 255 pages of an issue of the Pacific
Journal of Mathematics!

The proof has been simplified a bit since then, but not much. Versions
can be found in two different books, and there is a project underway to
verify it by computer:

6) Wikipedia, Feit-Thompson Theorem,
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feit-Thompson_theorem`

This theorem, also called the "odd order theorem", marked a trend
toward really long proofs in finite group theory, as part of a quest to
classify finite "simple" groups. A simple group is one that has no
nontrivial normal subgroups. In other words: there's no way to find a
smaller group inside it, mod out by that, and get another smaller group.
So, more loosely speaking, we can't build it up in several stages:
it's a single-stage affair, a basic building block.

One reason finite simple groups are important is that *every* finite
group can be built up in stages, where the group at each stage mod the
group at the previous stage is a finite simple group. So, the finite
simple groups are like the "prime numbers" or "atoms" of finite
group theory.

The first analogy is nice because *abelian* finite simple groups
practically *are* prime numbers. More precisely, every abelian finite
simple group is Z/p, the group of integers mod p, for some prime p. So,
building a finite group from simple groups is a grand generalization of
factoring a natural number into primes.

However, the second analogy is nice because just as you can build
different molecules with the same collection of atoms, you can build
different finite groups from the same finite simple groups.

I actually find a third analogy helpful. As I hinted, for any finite
group we can find an increasing sequence of subgroups, starting with the
trivial group and working on up to the whole group, such that each
subgroup mod the previous one is a finite simple group. So, we're
building our group as a "layer-cake" with these finite simple groups
as "layers".

But: knowing the layers is not enough: each time we put on the next
layer, we also need some "frosting" or "jam" to stick it on!
Depending on what kind of frosting we use, we can get different cakes!

To complicate the analogy, stacking the layers in different orders can
sometimes give the same cake. This is reminiscent of how multiplying
prime numbers in different orders gives the same answer. But, unlike
multiplying primes, we can't *always* build our layer cake in any order
we like.

Apart from the order, though, the layers are uniquely determined - just
as every natural number has a unique prime factorization. This fact is
called the "Jordan-HÃ¶lder theorem", and these layer cakes are usually
called "composition series". For more, try this:

7) Wikipedia, Composition series,
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_series`

But let's see some examples!

Suppose we want to build a group out of just two layers, where each
layer is the group of integers mod 3, otherwise known as Z/3. There are
two ways to do this. One gives Z/3 \oplus  Z/3, the group of pairs of integers
mod 3. The other gives Z/9, the group of integers mod 9.

We can think of Z/3 \oplus  Z/3 as consisting of pairs of digits 0,1,2 where
we add each digit separately mod 3. For example:

01 + 02 = 00\
12 + 11 = 20\
11 + 20 = 01

We can think of Z/9 as consisting of pairs of digits 0,1,2 where we add
each digit mod 3, but then carry a 1 from the 1's place to the 10's
place when the sum of the digits in the 1's place exceeds 2 - just like
you'd do when adding in base 3. I hope you remember your early math
teachers saying "don't forget to carry a 1!" It's like that. For
example:

01 + 02 = 10\
12 + 11 = 00\
11 + 20 = 01

So, the "frosting" or "jam" that we use to stick our two copies of
Z/3 together is the way we carry some information from one to the other
when adding! If we do it trivially, not carrying at all, we get Z/3 \oplus 
Z/3. If we do it in a more interesting way we get Z/9.

In fact, this how it always works when we build a layer cake of groups.
The frosting at each stage tells us how to "carry" when we add.
Suppose at some stage we've got some group G. Then we want to stick on
another layer, some group H. An element of the resulting bigger group is
just a pair (g,h). But we add these pairs like this:

(g,h) + (g',h') = (g + g' + c(h,h'), h + h')

where

c\colon  H \times H \to  G

tells us how to "carry" from the "H place" to the "G place" when
we add. So, information percolates down when we add two guys in the new
top layer of our group.

Of course, not any function c will give us a group: we need the group
laws to hold, like the associative law. To make these hold, the function
c needs to satisfy some equations. If it does, we call it a
"2-cocycle".

These cocycles are studied in a subject called "group cohomology".
Usually people focus on the simplest case, when our original group G is
abelian, and its elements commute with everything in the big new group
we're building. If this isn't true, we need something more general:
*nonabelian* group cohomology, often called "Schreier theory" (see
["Week 223"](#week223)).

I like this layer cake business because it's charming and it
generalizes in two nice ways. First of all, it works for lots of
algebraic gadgets besides groups. Second of all, it works for
*categorified* versions of these gadgets.

For example, a group is a category with one object, all of whose
morphisms are invertible. Similarly, an "n-group" is an $n$-category
with one object, all of whose $1$-morphisms, $2$-morphisms and so on are
invertible. We can build up $n$-groups as layer cakes where the layers are
groups. It's a more elaborate version of what I just described - and it
uses not just "2-cocycles" but also "3-cocycles" and so on. I never
really understand group cohomology until I learned to see it this way.

But what's *really* cool is that $n$-groups can also be thought of as
topological spaces. This lets us build every space as a "layer cake"
where the layers are groups! These groups are called the "homotopy
groups" of the space. The nth homotopy group keeps track of how many
n-dimensional holes the space has - see ["Week 102"](#week102) for
details.

But of course, they don't call the process of sticking these groups
together a "layer cake": that would be too undignified. They call it a
"Postnikov tower". And instead of "frosting", they speak of
"Postnikov invariants". Every space is the union of a bunch of
connected pieces, each of which is determined by its homotopy groups and
its Postnikov invariants.

(At least this is true if you count spaces as the same when they're
"weakly homotopy equivalent". This is a fairly sloppy equivalence
relation beloved by homotopy theorists. You've probably heard how a
topologist is someone who can't tell the difference between a doughnut
and a coffee cup. Actually they can tell: they just don't care! A
homotopy theorist is a more relaxed sort of guy who doesn't even care
about the difference between a doughnut and a Moebius strip. They're
both just fattened up versions of a circle.)

Mike Shulman and I tried to explain this layer cake business here:

8) John Baez and Michael Shulman, Lectures on $n$-categories and
cohomology, to appear in $n$-Categories: Foundations and Applications,
eds. John Baez and Peter May. Also available as
[`arXiv:math/0608420`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608420)

Whoops! I see I've drifted from my supposed topic - the work of John
Thompson - to something I actually understand. It was a digression, but
not a completely pointless one. From what I've told you, it follows
that every space with finite homotopy groups can be built as a fancy
"layer cake" made of finite simple groups.

And even better, the finite simple groups have now been classified! - we
think. There are 18 infinite series of these groups, and also 26
exceptions called "sporadic" groups, ranging in size from the five
Mathieu groups (see ["Week 234"](#week234)) on up to the Monster
(see ["Week 20"](#week20) and ["Week 66"](#week66)).

9) Wikipedia, List of finite simple groups,
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_finite_simple_groups`

Proving that these are all the possibilities took mathematicians about
10,000 pages of work! The Feit-Thompson theorem is a small but crucial
piece in this enormous pyramid of proofs. There could still be some
mistakes here and there, but experts are busy working through the
details more carefully.

Among the 26 sporadic groups, one is called the Thompson group. It was
discovered by Thompson, and it's a subgroup of a version of the group
\mathrm{E}_8 defined over F_3, the field with 3 elements. It has about 9 \times
10^16^ elements, and it has a 248-dimensional representation over F_3.
I don't know much about it. I mention it just to show what crazy
possibilities had to be considered to classify all finite simple groups
- and how deeply Thompson was involved in this work.

But what about Jacques Tits?

10) Mactutor History of Mathematics Archive, Jacques Tits
`http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tits.html`

He's not mentioned in du Sautoy's book "Symmetry", which is a pity,
but not surprising, since too many mathematicians have studied group
theory to fit comfortably in one story. He has a sporadic finite simple
group named after him, but his work leaned in a different direction,
more focused on the role of groups in geometry. He was an honorary
member of Bourbaki, and in that role he helped awaken interest in the
work of Coxeter.

I've mentioned his work on the "magic square" of exceptional Lie
groups in ["Week 145"](#week145) and
["Week 253"](#week253)... but he's more famous for his work on
"buildings", sometimes called "Bruhat-Tits buildings".

The subject of buildings has a reputation for being intimidating,
perhaps because the *definition* of a building looks scary and
unmotivated. You can read these and decide for yourself:

Personally I found it a lot easier to start with *examples*.

So, start with any "finite reflection group" - a finite group of
transformations of R^n that's generated by reflections. The
possibilities have been completely worked out, and I listed them back in
["Week 62"](#week62). But let's do an easy one: the symmetry group
of an equilateral triangle.

I can't resist mentioning that this group is also S_3, the group of
all permutations of the three vertices of the triangle. In fact, this
group was the star of ["Week 261"](#week261), where it showed up as
the Galois group of the cubic equation! We can solve a cubic using
radicals since this group is solvable. In other words, we can build this
group as a "layer cake" from the abelian groups Z/3 and Z/2. The
bottom layer is Z/3, the subgroup of even permutations. The top layer is
S_3 modulo the even permutations, namely Z/2. Galois theory says you
can solve a cubic by messing around a bit, then taking a square root,
and then taking a cube root. Why a square root *first?* Because you
build this sort of layer cake from the bottom up, but you eat it from
the top down, slicing off one layer at a time.

But now we want to think about how this group is generated by
reflections. You can use just two, for example the reflections across
the mirrors labelled r and s here:

                              s 
                     \       /
                      \     /
                       \   /
                        \ /
                 --------o--------r
                        / \
                       /   \
                      /     \
                     /       \

Let's call these reflections r and s. They clearly satisfy

r^2 = s^2 = 1

but since the mirrors are at an angle of \pi /3 from each other, they also
satisfy

(rs)^3 = 1

This gives a presesentation of our group S_3. We can summarize this
presentation with a little "Coxeter diagram":

          3
      r-------s

where the dots r and s are the generators, and the edge labelled "3"
is the interesting relation (rs)^3 = 1. I explained these diagrams more
carefully back in ["Week 62"](#week62). If you know about Dynkin
diagrams, these are pretty similar - see ["Week 63"](#week63) and
["Week 64"](#week64) for details.

Note that the mirrors in this picture:

                              s 
                     \       /
                      \     /
                       \   /
                        \ /
                 --------o--------r
                        / \
                       /   \
                      /     \
                     /       \

chop the plane into 6 "chambers", and the group S_3 has 6 elements.
This is no coincidence - it works like this for any finite reflection
group! We can pick any chamber as our favorite and label it 1:

                              s 
                     \       /
                      \     /  
                       \   /   1
                        \ /
                 --------o--------r
                        / \
                       /   \
                      /     \
                     /       \

Then, we can label any other chamber by the unique element of our group
that carries our favorite chamber to that one:

                              s 
                     \       /
                      \  s  /     
                  sr   \   /   1
                        \ /
                 --------o--------r
                        / \
            rsr = srs  /   \   r
                      / rs  \  
                     /       \

If we start with chamber 1 and keep reflecting across mirrors, we keep
getting products of more and more generators until we reach the
diametrically opposite chamber, which corresponds to the so-called
"long word" in our finite reflection group. In this case, the long
word is rsr = srs.

(Fanatical devotees will also note that this equation is the
"Yang-Baxter equation" mentioned in ["Week 261"](#week261).)

Now, Coxeter thought about all this stuff, and he realized that it was
nice to introduce a polytope with one face for each chamber - in this
case, just a hexagon:

                         s
                      o-----o
                  rs /       \1 
                    /         \
                   o           o
                    \         / 
                 rsr \       /r
                      o-----o
                        sr

This is called the "Coxeter complex" of our finite reflection group.
Our finite reflection group acts on it, and it acts on the faces in a
free and transitive way.

But, you'll note we started with the symmetry group of an equilateral
triangle, and wound up with a hexagon! What happened?

The quick way to say it is this: combinatorially speaking, the hexagon
is the "[barycentric
subdivision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_subdivision)" of
our original triangle. Not the inside of the triangle - just its
surface, or boundary! The boundary of the triangle is a simplicial
complex made of 3 vertices and 3 edges:

                      o
                      .  .   
                      .     . 
                      .        o
                      .     .  
                      .  .
                      o

so if we barycentrically subdivide it, we get 6 vertices and 6 edges:

                      o-----o
                     /       \
                    /         \
                   o           o
                    \         / 
                     \       /
                      o-----o

and that's our hexagon - drawn puffed out a bit, just for the sake of
prettiness.

If this seems bizarre - and it probably does, given how lousy these
pictures are - I urge you to try the next example on your own. Take the
symmetry group of the regular tetrahedron, also known as S_4, the group
of permutations of 4 things. Show it's generated by three reflections
r,s,t with relations

r^2 = s^2 = t^2 = 1

(rs)^3 = (st)^3 = 1

rt = tr

We can summarize these with the following Coxeter diagram:

          3       3
      r-------s-------t

Draw all mirrors corresponding to reflections in S_4, and show they
chop 3d space into 24 chambers, one for each element of S_4. Then,
barycentrically subdivide the boundary of the tetrahedron and check that
the resulting "Coxeter complex" has 24 faces, one inside each chamber.

Anyway, one thing Tits did is realize how these Coxeter complexes show
up in the geometry of the *Lie groups*, or more generally *algebraic
groups*, associated to Dynkin diagrams.

For example, if I take this guy:

          3
      r-------s

and remove some of the labels, I get the so-called A_2 Dynkin diagram:

      o-------o

which corresponds to the Lie group \mathrm{PSL}(3). And, this is the group of
symmetries of projective plane geometry! Each dot in the Dynkin
corresponds to a "type of figure":

    POINT    LINE
      o-------o

and the edge corresponds to an "incidence relation": in projective
plane geometry, a point can lie on a line. This shape, which we've seen
before:

                      o
                      .  .   
                      .     . 
                      .        o
                      .     .  
                      .  .
                      o

is then revealed to stand for a configuration of 3 points and 3 lines,
satisfying incidence relations obvious from the picture. To put points
and lines on an equal footing, we switch to the the Coxeter complex:

                   POINT    LINE      
                      o-----o
                     /       \
                    /         \
              LINE o           oPOINT
                    \         / 
                     \       /
                      o-----o
                  POINT     LINE

where now the vertices represent "figures" and the edges represent
"incidence relations". It turns out that inside any projective plane,
we can find lots of configurations like this: 3 points and 3 lines, each
pair of points lying on one of the lines, and each pair of lines
intersecting in a point. Such a configuration is called an
"apartment".

If we take all the apartments coming from a projective plane, they form
a simplicial complex called a "building". And this generalizes to any
geometry corresponding to any sort of Dynkin diagram. The building knows
everything about the geometry: all the figures, all the incidence
relations.

And that's all I have time for now, but it's just the beginning of the
marvelous theory Jacques Tits worked out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Addenda:** At least on Titan, tholins seem to be a complex brew of
compounds made by irradiation of molecular nitrogen and methane in the
upper atmosphere. The same sort of compounds could be an early chemical
step in the formation of life on Earth - that's one reason I'm
interested. They're related to PAHs, or "polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons", which are ubiquitous in outer space - I wrote about
those back in ["Week 258"](#week258). I guess the main difference
is that tholins contain nitrogen!

I found some more information on tholins here:

16) J. H. Waite, Jr., et al, The process of tholin formation in

You can see more discussion and also *questions I'm dying to know the
answers to* over at the [$n$-Category
CafÃ©](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/04/this_weeks_finds_in_mathematic_24.html).
Whenever I write This Week's Finds, I come up with lots of questions.
If you can help me with some of these, I'll be really grateful.
