# December 24, 2007 {#week260}

Since it's Christmas Eve, I thought I'd list some free books you can
download. I'm a big fan of giving the world presents... and I'm not
the only one.

But first, this week's nebulae! Here's one called the Retina:

::: {align="center"}

:::

1) Retina Nebula, Hubble Heritage Project,
`http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/14/`

This is actually a tube of ionized gas about a quarter of a light-year
across and one light-year long. It's a planetary nebula produced by a
dying star. If you zoom in and look closely, you can see this star
lurking in the middle, now a mere white dwarf.

The blue light is the most energetic, so it's really hot where you see
blue. This blue light comes from singly ionized helium - helium where
one electron has been knocked off. The green light is a bit less
energetic: that's from doubly ionized oxygen. The red light comes from
even cooler regions: that's from singly ionized nitrogen.

You can also see a lot of "dust lanes" in this photo. They're
beautiful. And they're big! The width of each one is about 160 times
the distance between the Sun and the Earth. The gas and dust in these
lanes is about 1000 times higher than elsewhere. But what creates them?

Apparently, when the fast-moving glowing hot gas from the star crashes
into the invisible gas in the surrounding interstellar space, the
boundary gets sort of crumpled, and these dust lanes form. It's vaguely
similar to the puffy surface of a cumulus cloud. But here the mechanism
is different, because it involves a "shock wave": the hot gas is
moving faster than the speed of sound as it hits the cold gas!

This effect is called a "Vishniac instability", since in 1983, the
astrophysicist Ethan Vishniac showed that a shock wave moving in a
sufficiently compressible medium would be subject to an instability of
this sort, growing as the square root of time. I've never seen how
Vishniac's calculations work, so the mathematics underlying this
beautiful phenomenon will have to wait for another day.

Note that this planetary nebula, like the others I've shown you, is far
from spherically symmetric. Astrophysicists used to pretend stars were
spherically symmetric. But, that's a bad approximation whenever
anything really exciting happens... just like in the [old
joke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow) where the punchline is
"consider a spherical cow".

As I said, the Retina Nebula is actually shaped like a tube. Viewed from
either end, this tube would look very different - probably like the Ring
Nebula:

::: {align="center"}
[![](ring_nebula.jpg){width="500"}](ring_nebula.jpg)
:::

2) Ring Nebula, Hubble Heritage Project,
`http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/01/`

This is one light-year across. Again we see He II blue light with a
wavelength of 4686 angstroms, then O III green light at 5007 angstroms,
then N II red light at 6584 angstroms. You can also see the white dwarf
as a tiny dot in the center; it's about 100,000 kelvin in temperature.

(In case you're wondering, an "angstrom" is an obsolete but popular
unit of distance, equal to 10^-10^ meters. Just like the "parsec",
it's a sign that astronomy is an old science. Anders Jonas Ångström was
one of the founders of spectroscopy, back around 1860. Archaic
conventions may also explain why singly ionized helium is called "He
II", and so on. Maybe the number zero hadn't fully caught on.)

Next: free books!

At least around here, Christmas seems to be all about buying stuff and
giving it away. Giving is good. But I think gifts have more soul if you
make them yourself. This is one of the great things about the internet:
it lets us create things and give them to *everyone in the world* - or
more precisely: everybody who wants them, and nobody who doesn't.

In this spirit, here's a roundup of free books on math and physics:
gifts from their authors to you. There are lots out there. I'll only
list a few. For more, try these sites:

3) George Cain, Online Mathematics Textbooks,
`http://www.math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html`

4) Free Online Mathematics Books,
`http://www.pspxworld.com/book/mathematics/`

5) Alex Stefanov, Textbooks in Mathematics,
`http://users.ictp.it/~stefanov/mylist.html` or (with annoying ads, but
more permanent) `http://us.geocities.com/alex_stef/mylist.html`

Despite its title, Stefanov's excellent site includes a lot of books on
physics. I can't find lists *specifically* devoted to free physics
books, but there are a lot out there - including a lot on the arXiv.

Anyway, let's dive in!

What if you're dying to learn physics, but don't know where to start?
Start here:

6) Physics Books Online,
`http://www.sciencebooksonline.info/physics.html`.

You'll find plenty of free online books, starting from the basics and
working up to advanced topics. But to dig deeper into these mysteries,
you'll eventually need to learn a bunch of math. Do you remember what
[Victor
Weisskopf](http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/conversations/Weisskopf/)
said when a student asked how much math a physicist needs to know?

"More."

This can be scary when you're just getting started. What if you don't
know calculus, for example?

Simple: learn calculus! This book is a classic - and it's free:

7) Gilbert Strang, Calculus, Wellesley-Cambridge Press, Cambridge,
1991. Also available at
`http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/strangtext.htm`

It really explains things clearly. I may use it the next time I teach
calculus. We professors need to quit making our students buy expensive
textbooks, and switch to free online books! We could join forces and
make wiki textbooks that are a lot better and more flexible than the
budget-busting, back-breaking mammoths we currently inflict on our kids.
But there are already a lot of good texts available free online.

Or: what if you know calculus, but you're still swimming through the
undergraduate sea of differential equations, Fourier transforms,
matrices, vectors and tensors? Then this should be really helpful:

8) James Nearing, Mathematical Tools for Physics, available at
`http://www.physics.miami.edu/~nearing/mathmethods/`

Unlike the usual dry and formal textbook, it reads like a friendly uncle
explaining things in plain English, trying to cut through the red tape
and tell you how to actually think about this stuff.

For example, on page 3 he introduces the hyperbolic trig functions:

> Where do hyperbolic functions come from? If you have a mass in
> equilibrium, the total force on it is zero. If it's in *stable*
> equilibrium then if you push it a little to one side and release it,
> the force will push it back to the center. If it is *unstable* then
> when it's a bit to one side it will be pushed farther away from the
> equilibrium point. In the first case, it will oscillate about the
> equilibrium position and the function of time will be a circular
> trigonometric function - the common sines or cosines of time,
> Acos(ωt). If the point is unstable, the motion will be described by
> hyperbolic functions of time, sinh(ωt) instead of sin(ωt). An ordinary
> ruler held at one end will swing back and forth, but if you try to
> balance it at the other end it will fall over. That's the difference
> between cos and cosh.

He goes into more detail later, after introducing the complex numbers.
This book also features some great animations of Taylor series and
Fourier series, like this movie of the Taylor series of the sine
function:

There are free online books at all levels... so let's soar a bit
higher. How about if you're a more advanced student trying to learn
general relativity? Here you go:

9) Sean M. Carroll, Lecture Notes on General Relativity, available as
[`arXiv:gr-qc/9712019`](http://arXiv.org/abs/arXiv:gr-qc/9712019)

How about quantum field theory? Then you're in luck - there are *two*
detailed books available online:

10) Warren Siegel, Fields, available as
[`arXiv:hep-th/9912205`](http://arXiv.org/abs/arXiv:hep-th/9912205)

10) Mark Srednicki, Quantum Field Theory, Cambridge U. Press,
Cambridge, 2007. Also available at
`http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html`

Or what about algebraic topology? Again you're in luck, since you can
read both Allen Hatcher's gentle introduction and Peter May's
high-powered "concise course":

11) Allen Hatcher, Algebraic Topology, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge,
2002. Also available at
`http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html`

12) Peter May, A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology, U. of Chicago
Press, Chicago, 1999. Also available at
`http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf`

May has a lot of more advanced topology books available at his website,
too - like this classic, where he used operads to solve important
problems involving loop spaces:

13) Peter May, The Geometry of Iterated Loop Spaces, Lecture Notes in
Mathematics 271, Springer, Berlin, 1972. Also available at
`http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/BOOKS/gils.pdf`

Or say you want to learn about vector bundles and how they show up in
physics, from the basics all the way to fancy stuff like D-branes and
K-theory? Try this - it's a great sequel to Husemoller's classic intro
to fiber bundles:

14) Dale Husemoller, Michael Joachim, Branislav Jurco and Martin
Schottenloher, Basic Bundle Theory and K-Cohomology Invariants, Lecture
Notes in Physics 726, Springer, Berlin, 2008. Also available at
`http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schotten/Texte/978-3-540-74955-4_Book_LNP726.pdf`

The list goes on and on! The American Mathematical Society will give you
books for free if you prove that you're not a robot by solving a little
puzzle:

15) American Mathematical Society, Books Online By Subject,
`http://www.ams.org/online_bks/online_subject.html`

Apparently they don't want robots learning advanced math and putting us
professors out of business by teaching with more charisma and flair. (By
the way: make sure to let them put cookies on your web browser, or
they'll send you an endless succession of these puzzles, without
explaining why!)

Since James Dolan and I plan to explain symmetric groups and their Hecke
algebras in our online seminar, this particular book from the AMS caught
my eye:

16) David M. Goldschmidt, Group Characters, Symmetric Functions, and
the Hecke Algebra, AMS, Providence, Rhode Island, 1993. Also available
as `http://www.ams.org/online_bks/ulect4/`

Since we're also struggling to understand the Langlands program, this
looks good too:

17) Armand Borel, Automorphic Forms, Representations, and $L$-functions,
AMS, 2 volumes, Providence, Rhode Island, 1979. Also available at
`http://www.ams.org/online_bks/pspum331/` and
`http://www.ams.org/online_bks/pspum332/`

It's a serious collection of expository papers by bigshots like Borel,
Cartier, Deligne, Jacquet, Knapp, Langlands, Lusztig, Tate, Tits,
Zuckerman, and many more.

"Motives" are the mysterious virtual building blocks that algebraic
varieties are built from. If you're ready to learn about motives - I'm
not sure I am - try this:

18) Marc Levine, Mixed Motives, AMS, Providence, Rhode Island, 1998.
Also available at `http://www.ams.org/online_bks/surv57/`

Or, if you're interested in using category theory to make analysis
clearer and more beautiful, try this:

19) Andreas Kriegl and Peter W. Michor, The Convenient \mathsf{Set}ting of
Global Analysis, AMS, Providence, Rhode Island, 1997. Also available at
`http://www.ams.org/online_bks/surv53/`

The focus is on getting and working with a "convenient category" of
infinite-dimensional manifolds. The idea of a "convenient category"
goes back to topology: at some point, people realized they wanted this
property to hold:

C(X \times Y, Z) \cong C(X, C(Y, Z))

Here C(X,Y) is the space of maps from X to Y. So, the isomorphism above
says that a map from X \times Y to Z should correspond to a map from X to
C(Y,Z). A category with this property is called "cartesian closed".
While it may not be obvious why, this property is so wonderful that
people threw out the category of topological spaces and continuous maps
and replaced it with a slightly different one, just to get this to hold.

Another sort of "convenient category" for differential geometry uses
infinitesimals. Again, you can learn about this in a free book:

20) Anders Kock, Synthetic Differential Geometry, Cambridge U. Press,
Cambridge, 2006. Also available at `http://home.imf.au.dk/kock/`

This category is not just cartesian closed - it's a topos!

If you don't know what a topos is, never fear - more free books are
coming to your rescue:

21) Robert Goldblatt, Topoi, the Categorial Analysis of Logic, Dover,
1983. Also available at
`http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=Gold010`

22) Michael Barr and Charles Wells, Toposes, Triples and Theories,
Springer, Berlin, 1983. Also available at
`http://www.case.edu/artsci/math/wells/pub/ttt.html`

The first one is so gentle it makes a good introduction to category
theory as a whole. The second scared the bejeezus out of me for a
decade, but now I like it.

I like Jordan algebras, so I was also pleased to see this classic
offered for free at the AMS website:

23) Nathan Jacobson, Structure and Representations of Jordan Algebras,
AMS, Providence, Rhode Island, 1968. Also available at
`http://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll39/`

Fans of exceptional Lie algebras will like the last two chapters, on
"connections with Lie algebras" and "exceptional Jordan algebras".

Speaking of Lie algebras, I'd never seen this textbook before:

24) Shlomo Sternberg, Lie Algebras,
`http://www.math.harvard.edu/~shlomo/docs/lie_algebras.pdf`

It's a somewhat quirky introduction, not for beginners I think, but it
features some nice special topics: character formulas, the Kostant Dirac
operator, and a detailed study of the center of the universal enveloping
algebra.

This intro to Lie groups is also a bit quirky, but if you like Feynman
diagrams or spin networks, it's irreplaceable:

25) Predrag Cvitanovic, Birdtracks, Lie's, and Exceptional Groups,
available at `http://www.nbi.dk/GroupTheory/`

One of the great things about this book is that it classifies simple Lie
groups according to their "skein relations" - properties of their
representations, written out diagrammatically. In so doing, Cvitanovic
realized that there's a "magic triangle" containing all the
exceptional Lie groups. This subsumes the "magic square" of
Freudenthal and Tits, which I discussed in ["Week 145"](#week145)
and my [octonion
webpages](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node16.html).

This idea of Cvitanovic is closely related to the "exceptional series"
of Lie groups - a pattern whose existence was conjectured by Deligne. I
love the term "exceptional series". It's an oxymoron, since the
exceptional groups were defined as those that don't fit into any
series. But, it makes sense!

To see the exceptional series, it helps to do a mental backflip called
"Tannaka-Krein duality", where you focus on the category of
representations of the Lie group, instead of the group itself. Then,
draw the morphisms in that category as diagrams, like Feynman diagrams!
Then see what identities they satisfy. New patterns leap out: new series
unify what had been "exceptions".

Very briefly, the idea goes like this. Suppose we have a Lie group G
with Lie algebra L. The Lie bracket takes two elements x and y and spits
out one element \[x,y\], and it's linear in each variable, so it gives
a linear operator

L \otimes L &rarr L

which is actually a morphism in the category of representations of G.

So, following the philosophy of Feynman diagrams, we can draw the
bracket operation like this:

                    \     /
                     \   /
                      \ /
                       |
                       |
                       |

We can even use this to state the definition of a Lie algebra using
diagrams! To say the bracket is antisymmetric:

\[y,x\] = -\[x,y\]

we just draw this:

                     \   /              |       |
                      \ /               |       |
                       /                |       |
                      / \               |       |
                     /   \               \     /
                     \   /     =    -     \   /
                      \ /                  \ /
                       |                    |
                       |                    |
                       |                    |

To say the Jacobi identity:

\[x,\[y,z\]\] = \[\[x,y\],z\] + \[y,\[x,z\]\]

we just draw this:

      \     \     /          \     /     /            \    /      /   
       \     \   /            \   /     /              \  /      /
        \     \ /              \ /     /                \       / 
         \     /                \     /                  \     /
          \   /        =         \   /         +       /  \   /
           \ /                    \ /                 /    \ /
            |                      |                  \     /
            |                      |                   \   /
            |                      |                    \ /
            |                      |                     |

If that's too cryptic, maybe this will explain what I'm doing:

     x     y       z        x       y     z          x      y      z
      \     \     /          \     /     /            \    /      /   
       \     \   /            \   /     /              \  /      /
        \     \ /              \ /     /                \       / 
         \     /                \     /                  \     /
          \   /        =         \   /         +       /  \   /
           \ /                    \ /                 /    \ /
            |                      |                  \     /
            |                      |                   \   /
            |                      |                    \ /
            |                      |                     |
       [x,[y,z]]              [[x,y],z]              [y,[x,z]]

But in fact, people usually massage this picture to make it even more
cryptic, and call it the "IHX" identity - since the three terms look
like the letters I, H, and X by the time they're done twisting them
around. For a good explanation, with pretty pictures, see:

26) Greg Muller, Chord diagrams and Lie algebras,
`http://cornellmath.wordpress.com/2007/12/25/chord-diagrams-and-lie-algebras/`

It then turns out that the exceptional Lie algebras \mathrm{F}_4, \mathrm{E}_6, \mathrm{E}_7 and
\mathrm{E}_8 satisfy *yet another* identity:

     \        /                
      \      /                
       ----/                
       |    |                       
       |    |           = 
       /----\            
      /      \

      \        /           \   /
       \      /             \ /

        /    \               |  
       /      \             / \  
      /        \           /   \  


      \     /       \        /         \        /
       \   /         \      /           \      /
        \ /           \    /             \____/ 
    B    /     +  B    |  |       +  B    ____

      /     \       /        \         /        \

for various choices of the constants A and B. So, they fit into a
"series"!

I believe the main point of this identity, going back to Vogel's paper
"Algebraic structures on modules of diagrams", is that for these Lie
algebras, the square of the quadratic Casimir is the only degree-4
Casimir.

I think there's a lot more to be discovered here, in part by taking the
gnarly computations people have done so far and making them more
beautiful and conceptual. So, I urge all fans of exceptional
mathematics, diagrams, and categories to look at these:

Alas, they avoid drawing Feynman diagrams, though they talk about them
in section 4. They prefer to use ideas from algebraic geometry:

Freudenthal's magic square, J. Algebra 239 (2001), 477-512. Also
available as [`arXiv:math/9908039`](http://arXiv.org/abs/math/9908039).

Deligne dimension formulas, Adv. Math. 171 (2002), 59-85. Also available
as [`arXiv:math/0107032`](http://arXiv.org/abs/math/0107032).

[`arXiv:math/0203241`](http://arXiv.org/abs/math/0203241).

Bruce Westbury, whom longtime readers of This Week's Finds will
remember as John Barrett's collaborator, has also worked on this
subject. He has pointed out that both the magic square and the magic
triangle can be given an extra row and column if we introduce a
6-dimensional algebra halfway between the quaternions and the octonions:

[`arXiv:math/0411428`](http://arXiv.org/abs/math/0411428).

This stuff has been on my mind recently, since I've been working on
exceptional groups and grand unified theories with my student John
Huerta. Also, my friend Tevian Dray has a student who just finished a
thesis on a related topic:

32) Aaron Wangberg, The structure of E6, available as
[`arXiv:0711.3447`](http://arXiv.org/abs/0711.3447).

In a nutshell: \mathrm{E}_6 is secretly \mathrm{SL}(3,O). Octonions rock!

Happy holidays. Keep learning cool stuff.

**Addenda:** Thomas Riepe listed some more free online math books. Tony
Smith pointed out something I already knew, but didn't make clear
above: the idea that \mathrm{E}_6 is secretly \mathrm{SL}(3,O) is far from new.

*If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an
idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it
to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of
it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less,
because every other possesses the whole of it.* - Thomas Jefferson
