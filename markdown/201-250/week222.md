week222

Last week there was a big conference on quantum gravity at the Albert
Einstein Institute near Berlin:

1\) Loops '05, `http://loops05.aei.mpg.de`

The focus was loop quantum gravity and spin foams, but there were also
talks about other approaches, so it was much bigger than last year's
get-together in Marseille. Last year about 100 people attended; this
time about 160 did! It was strange seeing old pals like Ashtekar,
Lewandowski, Loll, Rovelli and Smolin almost lost in a sea of new faces.
But, it was great to talk to everyone, both old and new.

I'll say more about this conference, but first let's talk about γ ray
bursters, a black hole without a host galaxy, the newly discovered moon
of planet Xena, and lots of other transneptunian objects.

Actually, just for fun, let's start with this science fiction novel I
picked up in Heathrow en route to Berlin:

2\) Charles Stross, Accelerando, Ace Books, New York. Also available at
`http://www.accelerando.org/book/`

This is one of the few tales I've read that does a good job of fleshing
out Verner Vinge's "Singularity" scenario, where the accelerating
development of technology soars past human comprehension and undergoes a
phase transition to a thoroughly different world. This is a real
possibility, and it's been discussed a lot:

3\) Wikipedia, Technological singularity,
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity`

Ray Kurzweil, The Singularity,
`http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?m=1`

Anders Sandberg, The Singularity,
`http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/`

However, it's not an easy subject for fiction - at least not for mere
human readers! Stross makes it gripping: sometimes goofy, sometimes
thrilling, and sometimes rather sad. Characters include a robot cat with
ever-growing powers and some space-faring uploaded lobsters.

The hero, Manfred Macx, starts out as a freeware developer, futurist and
all-purpose wheeler-dealer. Here's a scene from the beginning of the
book, before all hell breaks loose:

An idea a minute - and the book is free online: what more could you
want?

But right now, the big news in astronomy is *not* about a type III
civilization lurking beyond M31 (otherwise known as the Andromeda
Galaxy). It's some evidence that short γ ray bursts are caused by
collisions involving neutron stars and black holes!

Γ ray bursts are among the most energetic events known in the heavens.
They happen in galaxies throughout the universe; we see about one a day,
and each releases somewhere between 10^45^ and 10^47^ joules of energy.
The larger figure is what you'd get by turning the entire mass of the
Sun into energy.

There could be several kinds of γ ray bursts, but there seem to be at
least two: short and long. Short bursts last between 40 milliseconds and
10 seconds - imagine the whole Sun turning into energy that fast! Long
ones last between 10 and 100 seconds. The two kinds seem to be
qualitatively different: for example, the short ones consist of
higher-frequency γ rays. The big news is that they happen in different
kinds of galaxies!

In ["Week 204"](#week204), I described how people caught a long γ
ray burst in the act in March 2003. A γ ray detector aboard a satellite
relayed information to telescopes in Australia and Japan, allowing them
to spot a visible afterglow right after the burst. The details of this
glow fit the "hypernova" theory of long γ ray bursts.

The hypernova theory says that when a star more than 25 times heavier
than the Sun runs out of fuel and collapses, it forms a black hole that
sucks down the star's iron core before a normal supernova explosion can
occur. In just a few seconds, about a solar mass of iron spirals into
the black hole, forming a pancake-shaped disk as it goes down. In the
process, this disk becomes incredibly hot and shoots out jets of
radiation in the transverse directions. As they plow through the star's
outer layers, these jets create beams of γ rays.

The short bursts have been harder to catch. By the time a telescope on
Earth could be aimed at the spot where the γ rays were seen, no
afterglow could be seen!

So, in October 2004 NASA launched Swift: a γ-ray detecting satellite
equipped with an X-ray telescope and an ultraviolet/optical telescope
that can respond quickly whenever a burst is seen:

4\) Official NASA Swift homepage,
`http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftsc.html`

5\) Gamma-ray burst real-time sky map, `http://grb.sonoma.edu/`

On May 9th, 2005, Swift detected a short burst and caught 11 photons of
the burst's X-ray afterglow. Another short burst detected by HETE-II
had its X-ray afterglow caught by the Chandra X-ray satellite. Analysis
of these and two more short bursts has convinced some scientists that
they're caused by collisions between neutron stars and/or black holes:

6\) D. B. Fox et al, The afterglow of GRB050709 and the nature of the
short-hard γ-ray bursts, Nature 437 (October 2005), 849-850. Also
available at `http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/135397main_nature_fox_final.pdf`

Despite what the news media are saying, I don't see that this paper
"proves" the short γ-ray bursts are caused by such collisions.
Instead, I see some good pieces of evidence.

The faintness of the afterglows suggests some mechanism other than a
hypernova. But as far as I can tell, the best evidence is that short γ
ray bursts tend to happen near the edges of old galaxies, while the long
ones happen near the centers of young galaxies.

The center of a young galaxy is where you'd expect to find a really
huge Wolf-Rayet star, the sort that dies in a hypernova. The edge of an
old galaxy is where you'd expect to see black holes and neutron stars
collide. Why? Because such collisions can only happen long after stars
are first formed. First you need an orbiting pair of giant stars to go
supernova and collapse into neutron stars and/or black holes. Then you
need plenty more time for this pair to spiral down thanks to
gravitational radiation, and eventually collide. By then the pair may
sail off to the edge of the galaxy, thanks to the "kick" delivered by
the supernova explosions.

I hope astronomers can clinch the case for the collision theory of short
γ ray bursts. After all, these collisions involving neutron stars and
black holes are precisely what gravitational wave detectors like LIGO
and VIRGO are hoping to see! If we know to look for gravitational waves
precisely when we see short γ ray bursts, and we know where they're
coming from, we'll have a better chance of finding them.

(Of course, we'll also have a better chance of *fooling* ourselves into
*thinking* we found them, until we do some double-blind tests.)

By the way, LIGO is already analysing data to look for gravitational
waves. I talked about this in ["Week 189"](#week189), but here's
something new: now you can help them by running a cool screensaver
called Einstein\@Home on your computer! Check it out:

Speaking of black holes, last month the Hubble Space Telescope and the
Very Large Telescope in Chile detected a quasar that seems to have no
host galaxy:

Quasars are thought to be super massive black holes; they're usually
found in the centers of galaxies, where they devour stars and shoot out
enormously powerful jets of radiation. However, the quasar HE0450-2958
is surrounded only by a blob of ionized gas. Nearby, a wildly disturbed
spiral galaxy can be seen.

Compare HE0450-2958 (at left) with a normal quasar (at right):

The quasar HE0450-2958 is in the middle of the left-hand picture; the
disturbed galaxy is above and a completely irrelevant foreground star is

Did this quasar begin life in the middle of a galaxy and then get kicked
out when that galaxy collided with something containing a super-massive
black hole? What could that something be?

Puzzles, puzzles, in the sky....

Closer to home, astronomers at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii have
discovered that planet Xena has a moon!

They nicknamed it Gabrielle, after this famous TV character's sidekick:

9\) Michael E. Brown, The moon of the 10th planet,
`http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/moon/index.html`

If you hadn't heard about planet Xena, or you don't like the idea of
naming a planet after a TV character - even a "warrior princess" -
don't get worked up just yet. Xena's official name is currently 2003
UB~313~, and though she's larger than Pluto, the International
Astronomical Union has not decided whether she'll officially be
considered a planet.

If Xena becomes a planet, she'll probably be renamed Persephone, after
the reluctant queen of the underworld in Greek mythology. But, she may
have to settle for the status of a mere "transneptunian object", like
Quaoar and Sedna. Indeed, if Pluto had been discovered more recently,
folks probably wouldn't have called him a planet either.

If you haven't even heard of Quaoar and Sedna... well, you must be too
absorbed by mundane concerns to keep track of the burgeoning population
of our Solar System. But it's not too late to mend your ways! Impress
your friends by casually dropping some of this jargon:

-   **[Transneptunian
    object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object)** - any
    object that orbits the Sun at an average distance greater than that
    of Neptune. Neptune is about 30 AU from the Sun, meaning it's 30
    times farther from the Sun than we are. Transneptunian objects can
    be roughly divided into three kinds: Kuiper belt objects, scattered
    disc objects, and Oort cloud objects.
    ::: {align="CENTER"}
    [![](kuiper_oort.jpg){width="500"
    height="400"}](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt)
    :::

    -   **[Kuiper belt
        object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt)** - any object
        whose orbit lies in the Kuiper belt. This is the region in the
        ecliptic (the plane of the planets' orbits) between 30 and 50
        AU from the Sun. There are a bunch of planetoids in this belt.
        Beyond 50 AU there seems to be a sharp dropoff in their density.
        Three main kinds of Kuiper belt objects have been found so far:
        cubewanos, plutinos and twotinos.
        -   **[Cubewano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubewano)** - A
            cubewano is a Kuiper belt object whose orbit is not in
            resonance with any of the outer planets. The curious name
            comes from "QB1", since the first example was named [1992
            QB_1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2815760%29_1992_QB1).

            One of the biggest cubewanos is
            [Quaoar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaoar), with a
            diameter of about 1200 kilometers. This is about half the
            diameter of Pluto, or a third the size of the Moon: much
            bigger than anything in the asteroid belt!

            :::

            Folks believe Quaoar is a mixture of ice and rock. It's
            very dark in color, but last year crystalline water ice was
            detected on its surface, using infrared spectroscopy. This
            came as a surprise, because cosmic rays and solar wind
            should convert exposed ice crystals to the amorphous form of
            ice within about 10 million years. Could there have been
            liquid water volcanos active on Quaoar this recently?? Or
            maybe meteor impacts melt amorphous ice and then it
            crystallizes?

            Other big cubewanos include
            [Chaos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2819521%29_Chaos),
            [Varuna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20000_Varuna), and
            [Deucalion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53311_Deucalion).
            2003 EL61 and 2005 FY9 are even bigger, but they haven't
            got nice names yet.

        -   **[Plutino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutino)** - A
            plutino is a Kuiper belt object whose orbit is in 3:2
            resonance with Neptune: they go around the Sun twice while
            Neptune goes around three times. About a quarter of Kuiper
            belt objects are plutinos.

            The most famous plutino is
            [Pluto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto) itself, though
            some pedants argue that Pluto can't be a "little Pluto".
            Pluto is quite different than anything else we call a
            planet: it has an eccentric orbit that ranges between 30 and
            50 AU, and its orbit is tilted 17 degrees to the ecliptic.
            Its surface is light brown, consisting mainly of frozen
            nitrogen and carbon monoxide. When it comes near the sun, as
            it recently did, it also gets a thin atmosphere made of
            these gases.

            Other plutinos include
            [Ixion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28978_Ixion),
            [Orcus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90482_Orcus),
            [Rhadamanthus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/38083_Rhadamanthus),
            and Pluto's moon
            [Charon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_%28moon%29). If
            you know Greek mythology, you'll know these guys are all
            named after deities of the underworld.

        -   **[Twotino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twotino)** - A
            twotino is a Kuiper belt object whose orbit is in 2:1
            resonance with Neptune. These are rare compared to plutinos,
            and they're smaller, so they're stuck with boring names
            like 1996 TR66. There are also a couple of Kuiper belt
            objects in 4:3 and 5:3 resonances with Neptune.

    -   **[Scattered disc
        object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc)** - A
        scattered disc object is a Kuiper belt object that has been
        perturbed by interactions with Neptune into an orbit that is
        more eccentric or more tilted from the ecliptic.

        [Xena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_UB313) (or more
        properly 2003 UB~313~) is a highly eccentric scattered disc
        object whose orbit carries it between 40 to 100 AU from the sun.
        Its orbit is inclined a whopping 44 degrees, and it's locked in
        a complicated 17:5 resonance with Neptune. It's probably larger
        than Pluto - a reasonable rough guess is 2900 kilometers in
        diameter, as compared with 2400 for Pluto. Its surface has
        methane ice, and we now know it has a moon.

        It's quite possible that scattered disc objects are related to
        [centaurs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_%28planetoid%29),
        which are planetoids orbiting the Sun between Jupiter and
        Neptune. The centaurs may be Kuiper belt objects that got
        knocked towards the Sun instead of away from it! Centaurs have
        chaotic orbits and will probably either collide with something
        or be ejected from the Solar System.

    -   **[Oort cloud
        object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud)** - the Oort
        cloud is a hypothesized spherical cloud of comets, perhaps
        between 50,000 and 100,000 AU from the Sun. The idea is this
        cloud consists of leftovers from the original nebula that
        collapsed to form our Solar system, and comets come from this
        region when they are perturbed from their orbits by the gravity
        of other stars.

        Nobody has seen a certified Oort cloud object. The best
        candidate so far is
        [Sedna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/90377_Sedna), an object
        roughly 1500 kilometers in diameter with a wildly eccentric
        orbit taking it between 80 to 930 AU from the Sun.

        :::

        Sedna was discovered in 2004 when it was 90 AU from the Sun.
        It's redder than Mars, its temperature never rises above 23
        Kelvin, and its year lasts 11,250 years. It's the farthest
        known object in our Solar System, but still much closer than the
        Oort cloud was supposed to be. Maybe it's a drastic example of
        a scattered disc object, maybe it's part of an "inner Oort
        cloud"... or maybe the Oort cloud isn't as far out as people
        thought.

        The closest people have come to seeing the Oort cloud is seeing
        a "Bok globule":

        :::

        A Bok globule is a cloud of dust and gas that's collapsing to
        form a star. This one is about 12,500 AU across. The scientists
        who observed it say it's about the size of the Oort cloud. This
        just goes to show how little we know about the Oort cloud!

puzzle in celestial mechanics, but you can read more about that in the

Now I want to talk about Loops '05!

Instead of trying to review all the talks - a hopeless task, since there
were 86 - I'll just mention the *two* strands of work I find most
exciting.

First, there's new evidence that a quantum theory of pure gravity
(meaning gravity without matter) makes sense in 4-dimensional spacetime.

To understand why this is exciting, you have to realize that in some
quarters, the conventional wisdom says a quantum theory of pure gravity
can't possibly make sense, except as a crude approximation at large
distance scales, because this theory is "perturbatively
nonrenormalizable".

Very roughly, this means that as we zoom in and look at the theory at
shorter and shorter distance scales, it looks less and less like a
"free field theory" where gravitons zip about without interacting.
Instead, the interactions get stronger and more complicated!

So, in the jargon of the trade, we don't get a "Gaussian ultraviolet
fixed point".

Huh?

Well, roughly, an "ultraviolet fixed point" is a quantum field theory
that keeps looking the same as you keep viewing it on shorter and
shorter distance scales. A "Gaussian" ultraviolet fixed point is one
that's also a free quantum field theory: one where particles don't
interact.

If quantum gravity approached a Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point as we
zoomed in, we could calculate what gravitons do at arbitrarily high
energies (at least perturbatively, as power series in Newton's constant
- no guarantee that these series converge). Particle physicists would
then be happy and say the theory was "perturbatively renormalizable".

But, it's not.

The conventional wisdom concludes that to save quantum gravity, we must
include matter of precisely the right sort to *make* it perturbatively
renormalizable. This is the quest that led people first to supergravity
and ultimately to superstring theory - see ["Week 195"](#week195)
for more of this story.

But, as far back as 1979, the particle physicist Weinberg raised the
possibility that pure quantum gravity is "nonperturbatively
renormalizable", or "asymptotically safe". This means that as we zoom
in and look at the theory at shorter and shorter distance scales, it
approaches some theory *other than* that of noninteracting gravitons.

In other words, Weinberg was suggesting that pure quantum gravity
approaches a non-obvious ultraviolet fixed point - possibly a
"non-Gaussian" one.

The big news is that this seems to be true!

Even cooler, in this theory spacetime seems to act *2-dimensional* at
very short distance scales.

This idea has been brewing for a long time - I talked about it
extensively back in ["Week 139"](#week139). But now there's more
solid evidence for it, coming from two quite different approaches.

First, people doing numerical quantum gravity in the "causal dynamical
triangulations" approach are seeing this effect in their computer
calculations. This is what Renate Loll explained at Loops '05. The best
place to read the details is here:

19\) Jan Ambjørn, J. Jurkiewicz and Renate Loll, Reconstructing the
universe, Phys. Rev. D72 (2005) 064014. Also available as
[hep-th/0505154](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0505154).

but if you need something less technical, try this:

20\) Jan Ambjørn, J. Jurkiewicz and Renate Loll, The universe from
scratch, available as
[hep-th/0509010](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0509010).

The titles of their papers are a bit grandiose, but their calculations
are solid stuff - truly magnificent. I described their basic strategy in
my report on the Marseille conference in [week206](week206.html). So, I
won't explain that again. I'll just mention their big new result: in
pure quantum gravity, spacetime has a spectral dimension of 4.02 ± 0.1
on large distance scales, but 1.80 ± 0.25 in the limit of very short
distance scales!

Zounds! What does that mean?

The "spectral dimension" of a spacetime is the dimension as measured
by watching heat spread out on this spacetime: the short-time behavior
of the heat equation probes the spacetime at short distance scales,
while its large-time behavior probes large distance scales. Spectral
dimensions don't need to be integers - for fractals they're typically
not. But, Loll and company believe they're seeing spacetimes that are
*exactly* 2-dimensional in the limit of very small distance scales,
*exactly* 4-dimensional in the limit of very large scales, with a
continuous change in dimension in between. The error bars in the above
figures come from doing Monte Carlo simulations. They're just using
ordinary computers, not supercomputers. So, with more work one could
shrink their error bars and test their result.

My main worry about their work is that it uses a fixed slicing of
spactime by timelike slices. So, there's a danger that their procedure
breaks Lorentz-invariance, even in the continuum limit which they are
attempting to compute. I would like to find a way around this problem!

Luckily, some other people are getting similar results from a second
procedure that definitely does *not* break Lorentz invariance:

21\) Oliver Lauscher and Martin Reuter, Fractal spacetime structure in
asymptotically safe gravity, available as
[hep-th/0508202](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0508202).

Reuter spoke about all this work at Loops '05. The idea is to
investigate Weinberg's original idea in excruciatingly precise detail
using "renormalization group flow" ideas. The above paper is a review
of lots of others, and you need to read a bunch to get what's really
going on. The upshot, however, is that they find evidence for a
non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point in pure quantum gravity. Moreover,
the spectral dimension of spacetime approaches 2 in the limit of very
short distance scales.

Suppose this is all true. What does it mean?

Nobody knows yet; there are lots of attitudes one could take.

Ambjørn, Jurkiewicz and Loll could probably just plunge ahead and use
computers to calculate lots of things about quantum gravity. (Right now
they want to test their results in lots of ways.) One good thing would
be to include matter of various sorts and see how it affects the
conclusions.

Similarly, Lauscher and Reuter could just plunge ahead and compute, if
they wanted.

This is excellent. But personally, I'd like to find a beautiful theory
in which spacetime is 2-dimensional at short distance scales, which
reduces to general relativity at large scales. In other words, to redo
all these calculations "from the bottom up".

Unsurprisingly, I hope this beautiful theory is a spin foam model, since
spin foams are 2-dimensional and I like them a lot. I presented some
rough ideas on how one might invent such a model:

22\) John Baez, Towards a spin foam model of quantum gravity, talk at
Loops '05, available at `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/loops05/`

But, these ideas are very tentative and only time will tell if they
amount to anything. What's more important is that pure quantum gravity
seems to exist - as a theory, that is - and people seem to be learning
actual facts about it, instead of just arguing endlessly about it.
That's progress!

The second most exciting thing at Loops '05, in my biased opinion, was
the work of John Barrett, Laurent Freidel, Karim Noui and others on
"matter without matter" in 3d quantum gravity. Simply by carving a
Feynman-diagram-shaped hole in 3d spacetime and doing quantum gravity on
the spacetime that's left over, you get a good theory of quantum
gravity coupled to matter! You can even take the limit as Newton's
gravitational constant goes to zero and get ordinary quantum field
theory on flat spacetime!

This is mindblowingly beautiful, especially because lots of it is
already mathematically rigorous, and we can easily make more so. It's
even related to $n$-categories: my student Jeffrey Morton presented a
poster on this aspect.

Together with my student Derek Wise, Jeffrey Morton and I plan to have a
lot of fun studying this stuff. So, I won't talk about it more now -
I'll probably get around to saying more someday, especially about how
the whole story generalizes to 4 dimensions.

There's a lot more to say about Loops '05, but this will have to do.
In a while, a bunch of the talks should be visible on the conference
homepage.... that should give you a better idea of what happened.

Sounds like a possibility worth exploring. I'm no expert, so I can't
tell how likely this is. I agree that a collision with some other object
containing a super-massive black hole sounds a little odd, given that
this object - most plausibly another galaxy - has *not been seen*. I
wouldn't have ventured such a guess myself. But, it's mentioned on the
European Southern Observatory webpage I cite above. To quote:

Yeah! The US may still send a mission to Pluto before its atmosphere
freezes, despite delays and indecision. The "Pluto Express" satellite
was scheduled for launch in December 2004, but in 2000 NASA ordered a
stop-work order on the project, due to lack of money and rising cost
estimates. In 2003, Congress gave NASA money to proceed with the
project:

and I guess it's now called "New Horizons":

This webpage gives a timetable of:

-   launch in January 2005
-   slingshot off Jupiter in February 2007
-   arrival at Pluto and Charon in July 2015
-   exploration of Kuiper belt during 2016-2020

I wonder if they have any plans to study the Pioneer anomaly?

I'm shamefully ignorant of this, so ten minutes' research on the web
was able to double my knowledge. I got ahold of this paper online:

29\) B. Garfinkel, On resonance in celestial mechanics: a survey,
Celestial Mech. 28 (1982), 275-290, also available at
`http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1982CeMec..28..275G`

and while not easy to understand - I guess there's a huge body of work
on this subject - it uses Hamiltonian perturbation theory and continued
fractions to study resonance, and talks about a difference between
"shallow" and "deep" resonances.

The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are almost in 5:2 resonance, but this
is a "shallow" resonance, and Saturn wiggles back and forth around
this resonance with a period of about 880 years - an effect called the
"Great Inequality". The first person to study this was Laplace. I read
elsewhere that:

> The dynamics of the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system was recognized as
> problematic from the beginnings of perturbation theory. The problems
> are due to the so-called Great Inequality (GI), which is the
> Jupiter-Saturn 2:5 mean-motion near-commensurability.

This is from:

30\) F. Varadi, M. Ghil, and W. M. Kaula, The great inequality in a
planetary Hamiltonian theory, available as
[chao-dyn/9311011](http://arxiv.org/abs/chao-dyn/9311011).

This shallow 5:2 resonance is related to the continued fraction

    1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(14 + 1/(2 + .... ))))

which is close to 2/5.

The Pluto-Neptune 3:2 resonance, on the other hand, is a "deep
resonance" and related to the continued fraction

    1/(2 - 1/(2 + 1/(10 + .... )))

which starts out close to 2/3.

I wish I understood the connection between continued fractions and
dynamical systems better! I know it gives rise to the role of the Golden
Ratio in chaos theory, which I tried to explain in
["Week 203"](#week203). But, I don't understand it very deeply.

Robert Helling also asked:

I referred him to the work of Gerald Sussman, Jack Wisdom and others in
["Week 107"](#week107), but Jonathan Thornburg posted this reply:
