# September 18, 2005 {#week221}

After going to the Streetfest this summer, I wandered around China. I
began by going to a big conference in Beijing, the 22nd International
Congress on the History of Science. I learned some interesting stuff.
For example:

You may have heard of
[Andalusia,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia) that fascinating
melting-pot of cultures that formed when southern Spain was invaded by
Muslims. The eleventh century was the golden age of Andalusian astronomy
and mathematics, with a lot of innovation in astrolabes. During the
[Caliphate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Muslim_Occupation_of_the_Iberian_Peninsula)
(929-1031), three quarters of all mathematical manuscripts were produced
in [Cordoba](%20http://lexicorient.com/spain/photos/cordoba02.jpg), most
of the rest in
[Sevilla](%20http://images.encarta.msn.com/xrefmedia/sharemed/targets/images/pho/t054/T054900A.jpg),
and only a few in
[Granada](%20http://lexicorient.com/spain/photos/granada02.jpg) and
[Toledo](%20http://hopf.chem.brandeis.edu/Milos/PhotoMD/Images/Spain2001/Toledo_Alcazar.JPG).

I didn't understand the mathematical predominance of Cordoba when I
first heard about it, but the underlying reason is simple. The first
great Muslim dynasty were the
[Ummayyads](%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyads), who ruled from
Damascus. They were massacred by the
[Abbasids](%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid) in 750, who then
moved the capital to Baghdad. When [Abd
ar-Rahman](%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd-ar-Rahman_I) fled
Damascus in 750 as the only Ummayyad survivor of this massacre, he went
to Spain, which had already been [invaded by Muslim
Berbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Iberia) in 711.

Abd ar-Rahman made Cordoba his capital. And, by enforcing a certain
level of religious tolerance, he made this city into *the place to be*
for Muslims, Jews and Christians - the "ornament of the world", and a
beacon of learning - until it was sacked by Berber troops in 1009.

Other cities in Andalusia became important later. The great philosopher
[Ibn Rushd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes) - known to Westerners
by the Latin name "Averroes" - was born in Cordoba in 1128. He later
became a judge there. He studied mathematics, medicine, and astronomy,
and wrote detailed line-by-line commentaries on the works of Aristotle.
It was through these commentaries that most of Aristotle's works,
including his Physics, found their way into Western Europe! By 1177, the
bishop of Paris had banned the teaching of many of these new ideas - but
to little effect.

Toledo seems to have only gained real prominence after [Alfonso
VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_VI_of_Castile) made it his
capital upon capturing it in 1085 as part of the Christian
"reconquista". By the 1200s, it became a lively center for translating
Arabic and Hebrew texts into Latin.

Mathematics also passed from the Arabs to Western Europe in other ways.
[Fibonacci](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Fibonacci.html)
(1170-1250) studied Arabic accounting methods in North Africa where his
father was a diplomat. His book *Liber Abaci* was important in
transmitting the Indian system of numerals (including zero) from the
Arabs to Europe. However, he wasn't the first to bring these numbers to
Europe. They'd been around for over 200 years!

For example: [Gerbert
d'Aurillac](%20http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerbert_of_Aurillac)
(940-1003) spent years studying mathematics in various Andalusian cities
including Cordoba. On his return to France, he wrote a book about a
cumbersome sort of "abacus" labelled by a Western form of the Indian
numerals - close to what we now call "Arabic numerals". This remained
popular in intellectual circles until the mid-12th century.

Amusingly, Arabic numerals were also called "dust numerals" since they
were used in calculations on an easily erasable "dust board". Their
use was described in the *Liber Pulveris*, or "book of dust".

I want to learn more about Andalusian science! I found this book a great
place to start - it's really fascinating:

1) Maria Rose Menocal, The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and
Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain, Little,
Brown and Co., 2002.

For something quick and pretty, try this:

2) Steve Edwards, Tilings from the Alhambra,
`http://www2.spsu.edu/math/tile/grammar/moor.htm`

Apparently 13 of the 17 planar symmetry groups can be found in tile
patterns in the Alhambra, a Moorish palace built in Granada in the
1300s.

To dig deeper into the splendors of Arabic mathematics, try these:

forgotten brilliance?,

mathematicians,
`http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Indexes/Arabs.html`

For more on Fibonacci and Arabic mathematics, try this paper by Charles
Burnett, who spoke about the history of "Arabic numerals" in Beijing:

4) Charles Burnett, Leonard of Pisa and Arabic Arithmetic,
`http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=472`

Another interesting talk in Beijing was about the role of the Syriac
language in the transmission of Greek science to Europe. Many important
texts didn't get translated directly from Greek to Arabic! Instead,
they were first translated into *Syriac*.

I don't understand the details yet, but luckily there's a great book
on the subject, available free online:

5) De Lacy O'Leary, How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs, Routledge &
Kegan Paul Ltd, 1949. Also available at
`http://www.aina.org/books/hgsptta.htm`

So, medieval Europe learned a lot of Greek science by reading Latin
translations of Arab translations of Syriac translations of second-hand
copies of the original Greek texts!

George Baloglu recommends this book:

6) Dimitri Gutas, Greek Thought, Arabic Culture: The Graeco-Arabic
Translation Movement in Baghdad and Early 'Abbasid Society
(2nd-4th/8th-10th Centuries), Routledge, 1998.

I want to read this book, too:

7) Scott L. Montgomery, Science in Translation: Movements of Knowledge
through Cultures and Time, U. of Chicago Press, 2000. Review by William
R. Everdell available at MAA Online,
`http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/science-in-translation-movements-of-knowledge-through-cultures-and-time`

The historian of science John Stachel, famous for his studies of
Einstein, says this book "strikes a blow at one of the founding myths
of 'Western Civilization'" - namely, that Renaissance Europeans
single-handedly picked up doing science where the Greeks left off. As
Everdell writes in his review:

And now for something completely different: the Langlands program! I
want to keep going on my gradual quest to understand and explain this
profoundly difficult hunk of mathematics, which connects number theory
to representations of algebraic groups. I've found this introduction to
be really helpful:

8) Stephen Gelbart: An elementary introduction to the Langlands
program, Bulletin of the AMS 10 (1984), 177-219.

There are a lot of more detailed sources of information on the Langlands
program, but the problem for the beginner (me) is that the overall goal
gets swamped in a mass of technicalities. Gelbart's introduction does
the best at avoiding this problem.

I've also found parts of this article to be helpful:

9) Edward Frenkel, Recent advances in the Langlands program, available
at [math.AG/0303074](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0303074).

It focuses on the "geometric Langlands program", which I'd rather not
talk about now. But, it starts with a pretty clear introduction to the
basic Langlands stuff... at least, clear to me after I've battered my
head on this for about a year!

If you know some number theory or you followed recent issues This
Week's Finds (especially ["Week 217"](#week217) and
["Week 218"](#week218)) it should make sense, so I'll quote it:

Since I haven't talked about Hecke operators yet, I'll stop here!

But, someday I should really explain the ideas behind the baby
"abelian" case of the Langlands philosophy in simpler terms than
Frenkel does here. The abelian case goes back way before Langlands:
it's called "class field theory". And, it's all about exploiting
this analogy, which I last mentioned in ["Week 218"](#week218):

**Addendum:** I thank Fabien Besnard for some suggestions on how to
improve this Week's Finds. Bruce Smith, Noam Elkies, and Miguel
Carrión-Álvarez had some things to say about the history of science. In
response to this comment of mine:

my friend Bruce wrote:

Something like this almost certainly true.

Like Plato, Aristotle is believed to have written dialogs which
presented his ideas in a polished form. They were all lost. His extant
writings are just "lecture notesquot; for courses he taught!

Euripides wrote at least 75 plays, of which only 19 survive in their
full form. We have fragments or excerpts of some more. This isn't
philosophy or math, but it's still incredibly tragic (pardon the pun).

The mathematician Apollonius wrote a book on *Tangencies* which is lost.
Only four of his eight books on *Conics* survive in Greek. Luckily, the
first seven survive in Arabic.

The burning of the library of Alexandria is partially to blame for these
losses.

There's some good news, though:

Archimedes did more work on calculus than previously believed! We know
this now because a manuscript of his on mechanics that had been erased
and written over has recently been read with the help of a synchrotron
X-ray beam! This is a great example of modern science helping the
history of science.

This manuscript, called the Archimedes Palimpsest, also reveals for the
first time that he did work on combinatorics:

Also: a team using "multispectral imaging" has recently been able to
read parts of a Roman library in the town of
[Herculaneum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum). The books in
this library were "roasted in place" - heavily carbonized - during the
eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed
[Pompeii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii). By distinguishing
between different shades of black, researchers were able to reconstruct
the entire book *On Piety* by one Philodemus:

13) Julie Walker, A library of mud and ashes, BYU Magazine, Spring
2001, `http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&a=43`

I can't resist quoting a bit:

The same team is now studying over 400,000 fragments of papyrus found in
an ancient garbage dump in the old Egyptian town of
[Oxyrhynchus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus). They've pieced
together new fragments of plays by Euripides, Sophocles and Menander,
lost lines from the poets Sappho, Hesiod, and Archilocus, and most of a
book by Hesiod:

Interesting! While "calculus" refers back to pebbles.
