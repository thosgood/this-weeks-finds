# March 23, 2007 {#week247}

Symmetry has fascinated us throughout the ages. Greek settlers in Sicily
may have seen irregular 12-sided crystals of pyrite in Sicily and dreamt
up the regular dodecahedron simply because it was more beautiful, more
symmetrical.
$$\href{www.minerals.net/mineral/sulfides/pyrite/pyrite.htm}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/pyrite.jpg}}$$
The Alhambra, a Moorish palace in Granada built around 1300, has tile
patterns with at least 13 of the 17 possible symmetry groups:

1) Branko Gr√ºnbaum, "What symmetry groups are present in the Alhambra?", _Notices of the AMS_ **53** (2006), 670--673. Also available at `http://www.ams.org/notices/200606/comm-grunbaum.pdf`

You can see some of these patterns here:

2) "Moresque tiles", `http://www.spsu.edu/math/tile/grammar/moor.htm`

Recently, Peter Lu and Paul Steinhardt discovered that Islamic tile
designs also include "quasicrystals". A perfectly repetitive tiling
can't have $5$-fold symmetry. Nor can a $3$-dimensional crystal: that's
why the dodecahedra formed by pyrite aren't regular. But by using
patterns that never quite repeat, the Islamic artists achieved
*approximate* $5$-fold symmetry:

Here's an example from the [I'timad al-Daula mausoleum](http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.tcl?site_id=7544)
in the Indian city of Agra, built by Islamic conquerors in 1622 -
together with a more mathematical version constructed by Lu and
Steinhardt:

Here's another, from the [Darb-i Imam shrine](http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.tcl?site_id=8380) in
Isfahan, Iran, also built in the 1600s:
$$\href{http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/quasicrystal_Darb-i_Imam.jpg}}$$
This came as a big surprise, since everyone had *thought* that the math
behind quasicrystals was first discovered by Penrose around 1974, then
seen in nature by Shechtman, Blech, Gratias and Cahn in 1983. It goes to
show that the appeal of symmetry, even in its subtler forms, is very
old! It also goes to show that you can make big discoveries just by
looking carefully at what's in front of you.

For more on quasicrystals, try this:

4) Steven Webber, "Quasicrystals", `http://www.jcrystal.com/steffenweber/`

Of course, the appeal of symmetry didn't end with ancient Greeks or
medieval Islamic monarchs. It also seems to have gotten ahold of John
Fry, chief executive of Fry's Electronics --- a chain of retail shops
whose motto is "Your best buys are always at Fry's". In 1994 he set
up something called the American Institute of Mathematics. The
headquarters was in a Fry's store in Palo Alto --- not very romantic. But
last year, this institute announced plans to move to a full-scale
replica of the Alhambra!

And this week, the institute flexed its mighty PR muscles and coaxed
reporters from the New York Times, BBC, Le Monde, Scientific American,
Science News, and so on to write about a highly esoteric advance in our
understanding of symmetry --- a gargantuan calculation involving the Lie
group $\mathrm{E}_8$:

6) American Institute of Mathematics, Mathematicians map $\mathrm{E}_8$, `http://aimath.org/E8`

The calculation is indeed huge. The *answer* takes up 60 gigabytes of
data: the equivalent of 45 days of music in MP3 format. If this
information were written out on paper, it would cover Manhattan!

But what's the calculation *about?* It almost seems a good explanation
of that would *also* cover Manhattan. I took a stab at it here:

7) John Baez, "News about $\mathrm{E}_8$", `http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/03/news_about_e8.html`

but I only got as far as sketching a description of $\mathrm{E}_8$ and some
gadgets called $R$-polynomials. Then come Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, and
Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials.... For more details, follow the
links, especially to the page written by Jeffrey Adams, who led the
project.

In weeks to come, I'll say more about some topics tangentially related
to this calculation --- especially flag varieties, representation theory
and the Weil conjectures. I may even talk about Kazhdan-Lusztig
polynomials!

For starters, though, let's just look at some pretty pictures by John
Stembridge that hint at the majesty of $\mathrm{E}_8$. Then I'll sketch the real
subject of Weeks to come: symmetry, geometry, and "groupoidification".

To warm up to $\mathrm{E}_8$, let's first take a look at $\mathrm{D}_4$, $\mathrm{D}_5$, $\mathrm{E}_6$, and
$\mathrm{E}_7$.

In ["Week 91"](#week91) I spoke about the $\mathrm{D}_4$ lattice. To get
this, first take a bunch of equal-sized spheres in 4 dimensions. Stack
them in a hypercubical pattern, so their centers lie at the points with
integer coordinates. A bit surprisingly, there's a lot of room left
over --- enough to fit in another copy of this whole pattern: a bunch of
spheres whose centers lie at the points with *half-integer* coordinates!

If you stick in these extra spheres, you get the densest known packing
of spheres in 4 dimensions. Their centers form the "$\mathrm{D}_4$ lattice".
It's an easy exercise to check that each sphere touches 24 others. The
centers of these 24 are the vertices of a marvelous shape called the
"$24$-cell" --- one of the six $4$-dimensional Platonic solids. It looks
like this:
$$\href{https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/conway_smith/}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/24_cell.jpg}}$$

8) John Baez, picture of $24$-cell, in "a review of On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic and Symmetry, by John H. Conway and Derek A. Smith', available at `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/conway_smith/`

Here I'm using a severe form of perspective to project 4 dimensions
down to 2. The coordinate axes are drawn as dashed lines; the solid
lines are the edges of the $24$-cell.

How about in 5 dimensions? Here the densest known packing of spheres
uses the "$\mathrm{D}_5$ lattice". This is a lot like the $\mathrm{D}_4$ lattice... but
only if you think about it the right way.

Imagine a $4$-dimensional checkerboard with "squares" --- really
hypercubes! --- alternately colored red and black. Put a dot in the middle
of each black square. Voila! You get a rescaled version of the $\mathrm{D}_4$
lattice. It's not instantly obvious that this matches my previous
description, but it's true.

If you do the same thing with a $5$-dimensional checkerboard, you get the
"$\mathrm{D}_5$ lattice", by definition. This gives the densest known packing of
spheres in 5 dimensions. In this packing, each sphere has 40 nearest
neighbors. The centers of these nearest neighbors are the vertices of a
solid that looks like this:
$$\href{http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jrs/}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/d5_stembridge.jpg}}$$

9) John Stembridge, "$\mathrm{D}_5$ root system", available at `http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jrs/data/coxplanes/`

If you do the same thing with a $6$-dimensional checkerboard, you get the
"$\mathrm{D}_6$ lattice"... and so on.

However, in 8 dimensions something cool happens. If you pack spheres in
the pattern of the $\mathrm{D}_8$ lattice, there's enough room left to stick in
an extra copy of this whole pattern! The result is called the "$\mathrm{E}_8$
lattice". It's twice as dense as the $\mathrm{D}_8$ lattice.

If you then take a well-chosen $7$-dimensional slice through the origin of
the $\mathrm{E}_8$ lattice, you get the $\mathrm{E}_7$ lattice. And if you take a
well-chosen $6$-dimensional slice of this, you get the $\mathrm{E}_6$ lattice. For
precise details on what I mean by "well-chosen", see
["Week 65"](#week65).

$\mathrm{E}_6$ and $\mathrm{E}_7$ give denser packings of spheres than $\mathrm{D}_6$ and $\mathrm{D}_7$. In
fact, they give the densest known packings of spheres in 6 and 7
dimensions!

In the $\mathrm{E}_6$ lattice, each sphere has 72 nearest neighbors. They form the
vertices of a solid that looks like this:

In the $\mathrm{E}_7$ lattice, each sphere has 126 nearest neighbors. They form
the vertices of a solid like this:

the vertices of a solid like this:

Faithful readers will know I've discussed these lattices often before.
For how they give rise to Lie groups, see ["Week 63"](#week63). For
more about "ADE classifications", see ["Week 64"](#week64) and
["Week 230"](#week230). I haven't really added much this time,
except Stembridge's nice pictures. I'm really just trying to get you
in the mood for a big adventure involving all these ideas: the Tale of
Groupoidification!

If we let this story lead us where it wants to go, we'll meet all sorts
of famous and fascinating creatures, such as:

- Coxeter groups, buildings, and the quantization of logic
- Hecke algebras and Hecke operators
- categorified quantum groups and Khovanov homology
- Kleinian singularities and the McKay correspondence
- quiver representations and Hall algebras
- intersection cohomology, perverse sheaves and Kazhdan-Lusztig theory

However, the charm of the tale is how many of these ideas are unified
and made simpler thanks to a big, simple idea: groupoidification.

So, what's groupoidification? It's a method of exposing the
combinatorial underpinnings of linear algebra --- the hard bones of set
theory underlying the flexibility of the continuum.

Linear algebra is all about vector spaces and linear maps. One of the
lessons that gets drummed into you when you study this subject is that
it's good to avoid picking bases for your vector spaces until you need
them. It's good to keep the freedom to do coordinate
transformations... and not just keep it in reserve, but keep it
*manifest!*

As Hermann Weyl wrote, "The introduction of a coordinate system to
geometry is an act of violence".

This is a deep truth, which hits many physicists when they study special
and general relativity. However, as Niels Bohr quipped, a deep truth is
one whose opposite is also a deep truth. There are some situations where
a vector space comes equipped with a god-given basis. Then it's foolish
not to pay attention to this fact!

The most obvious example is when our vector space has been *defined* to
consist of formal linear combinations of the elements of some set. Then
this set is our basis.

This often happens when we use linear algebra to study combinatorics.

But if sets give vector spaces, what gives linear operators? Your first
guess might be *functions*. And indeed, functions between sets do give
linear operators between their vector spaces. For example, suppose we
have a function
$$f\colon \{\mathrm{livecat}, \mathrm{deadcat}\} \to \{\mathrm{livecat}, \mathrm{deadcat}\}$$
which "makes sure the cat is dead":
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    f(\mathrm{livecat}) &= \mathrm{deadcat}
  \\f(\mathrm{deadcat}) &= \mathrm{deadcat}
  \end{aligned}
$$
Then, we can extend $f$ to a linear operator defined on formal linear
combinations of cats:
$$F(a \mathrm{livecat} + b \mathrm{deadcat}) = a \mathrm{deadcat} + b \mathrm{deadcat}$$
Written as a matrix in the $\{\mathrm{livecat}, \mathrm{deadcat}\}$ basis, this looks like
$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\1&1\end{array}\right)$$
(The relation to quantum mechanics here is just a vague hint of themes
to come. I've deliberately picked an example where the linear operator
is *not* unitary.)

So, we get some linear operators from functions... but not all! We only
get operators whose matrices have exactly a single $1$ in each column, the
rest of the entries being $0$. That's because a function $f\colon X \to Y$ sends
each element of $X$ to a single element of $Y$.

This is very limiting. We can do better if we get operators from
*relations* between sets. In a relation between sets $X$ and $Y$, an element
of $X$ can be related to any number of elements of $Y$, and vice versa. For
example, let the relation
$$R\colon \{1,2,3,4\} \nrightarrow \{1,2,3,4\}$$
be "is a divisor of". Then $1$ is a divisor of everybody, $2$ is a divisor
of itself and $4$, $3$ is only a divisor of itself, and $4$ is only a divisor
of itself. We can encode this in a matrix:
$$
  \left(
    \begin{array}{cccc}
      1&0&0&0
    \\1&1&0&0
    \\1&0&1&0
    \\1&1&0&1
    \end{array}
  \right)
$$
where $1$ means "is a divisor of" and $0$ means "is not a divisor of".

We can get any matrix of $0$'s and $1$'s this way. Relations are really
just matrices of truth values. We're thinking of them as matrices of
numbers. Unfortunately we're still far from getting *all* matrices of
numbers!

We can do better if we get matrices from *spans* of sets. A span of
sets, written $S\colon X \nrightarrow Y$, is just a set $S$ equipped with functions to $X$
and $Y$. We can draw it like this:
$$
  \begin{tikzcd}
    &S\drar["F"]\dlar[swap,"G"]&
  \\X&&Y
  \end{tikzcd}
$$
It's supposed to look like a bridge --- hence the term "span".

Spans of sets are like relations, but where you can be related to
someone more than once!

For example, $X$ could be the set of Frenchman and $Y$ could be the set of
Englishwomen. $S$ could be the set of Russians. As you know, every Russian
has exactly one favorite Frenchman and one favorite Englishwoman. So, $F$
could be the function "your favorite Frenchman", and $G$ could be "your
favorite Englishwoman".

Then, given a Frenchman $x$ and an Englishwoman $y$, they're related by the
Russian $s$ whenever $s$ has $x$ as their favorite Frenchman and $y$ as their
favorite Englishwoman:
$$F(s) = x and G(s) = y.$$
Some pairs $(x,y)$ will be related by no Russians, others will be related
by one, and others will be related by more than one! I bet the pair
$$(x,y) = (\mbox{G√©rard Depardieu}, \mbox{Emma Thompson})$$
is related by at least 57 Russians.

This idea lets us turn spans of sets into matrices of natural numbers.
Given a span of finite sets:
$$
  \begin{tikzcd}
    &S\drar["F"]\dlar[swap,"G"]&
  \\X&&Y
  \end{tikzcd}
$$
we get an $X \times Y matrix$ whose $(x,y)$ entry is the number of Russians --- I
mean elements $s$ of $S$ --- such that
$$F(s) = x and G(s) = y.$$
We can get any finite-sized matrix of natural numbers this way.

Even better, there's a way to "compose" spans that nicely matches the
usual way of multiplying matrices. You can figure this out yourself if
you solve this puzzle:

> Let $X$ be the set of people on Earth. Let $T$ be the $X \times X$ matrix
> corresponding to the relation "is the father of". Why does the
> matrix $T^2$ correspond to the relation "is the paternal grandfather
> of"? Let $S$ correspond to the relation "is a friend of". Why
> doesn't the matrix $S^2$ correspond to the relation "is a friend of a
> friend of"? What span does this matrix correspond to?

To go further, we need to consider spans, not of sets, but of groupoids!

I'll say more about this later --- I suspect you're getting tired. But
for now, briefly: a groupoid is a category with inverses. Any group
gives an example, but groupoids are more general --- they're the modern
way of thinking about symmetry.

There's a way to define the cardinality of a finite groupoid:

12) John Baez and James Dolan, "From finite sets to Feynman diagrams", in _Mathematics Unlimited --- 2001 and Beyond_, vol. 1, eds. Bjorn Engquist and Wilfried Schmid, Springer, Berlin, 2001, pp. 29--50. Also available as [`math.QA/0004133`](https://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0004133).

And, this can equal any nonnegative *rational* number! This lets us
generalize what we've done from finite sets to finite groupoids, and
get rational numbers into the game.

A span of groupoids is a diagram
$$
  \begin{tikzcd}
    &S\drar["F"]\dlar[swap,"G"]&
  \\X&&Y
  \end{tikzcd}
$$
where $X,Y,S$ are groupoids and $F,G$ are functors. If all the groupoids
are finite, we can turn this span into a finite-sized matrix of
nonnegative rational numbers, by copying what we did for spans of finite
sets.

There's also a way of composing spans of groupoids, which corresponds
to multiplying matrices. However, there's a trick involved in getting
this to work --- I'll have to explain this later. For details, try:

13) Jeffrey Morton, "Categorified algebra and quantum mechanics", _Theory and Application of Categories_ **16** (2006), 785--854. Available at `http://www.emis.de/journals/TAC/volumes/16/29/16-29abs.html`; also available as [`math.QA/0601458`](https://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0601458).

14) Simon Byrne, _On Groupoids and Stuff_, honors thesis, Macquarie University, 2005, available at `http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~street/ByrneHons.pdf` and `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-spring2004/ByrneHons.pdf`

Anyway: the idea of "groupoidification" is that in many cases where
mathematicians think they're playing around with linear operators
between vector spaces, they're *actually* playing around with spans of
groupoids!

This is especially true in math related to simple Lie groups, their Lie
algebras, quantum groups and the like. While people usually study these
gadgets using linear algebra, there's a lot of combinatorics involved ---
and where combinatorics and symmetry show up, one invariably finds
groupoids.

As the name suggests, groupoidification is akin to categorification.
But, it's a bit different. In categorification, we try to boost up
mathematical ideas this way:

> sets $\to$ categories\
> functions $\to$ functors\

In groupoidification, we try this:

> vector spaces $\to$ groupoids\
> linear operators $\to$ spans of groupoids\

Actually, it's "decategorification" and "degroupoidification" that
are systematic processes. These processes lose information, so there's
no systematic way to reverse them. But, as I explained in
["Week 99"](#week99), it's still fun to try! If we succeed, we
discover an extra layer of structure beneath the math we thought we
understood... and this usually makes that math *clearer* and *less
technical*, because we're not seeing it through a blurry,
information-losing lens.

Okay, that's enough for now. On a completely different note, here's a
book on "structural realism" and quantum mechanics:

Very loosely speaking --- I ain't no philosopher --- structural realism is
the idea that what's "real" about mathematics, or the abstractions in
physical theories, are not individual entities but the structures, or
patterns, they form. So, instead of asking tired questions like "What
is the number 2, really?" or "Do points of spacetime really exist?",
we should ask more global questions about the roles that structures like
"natural numbers" or "spacetime" play in math and physics. It's a
bit like how in category theory, we can only understand an object in the
context of the category it inhabits.

Finally, here's a puzzle for lattice and Lie group fans. The dots in
Stembridge's pictures are the shortest nonzero vectors in the $\mathrm{D}_5$,
$\mathrm{E}_6$, $\mathrm{E}_7$, and $\mathrm{E}_8$ lattices --- or in technical terms, the "roots". Of
course, only for ADE Dynkin diagrams are the roots all of equal length ---
but those are the kind we have here. Anyway: in the $\mathrm{D}_5$ case, only 32
of the 40 roots are visible. The other 8 are hidden in back somewhere.
Where are they?

I asked John Stembridge about this and he gave a useful clue. His planar
pictures show projections of the roots into what he calls the "Coxeter
plane".

Recall from ["Week 62"](#week62) that the "Coxeter group"
associated to a Dynkin diagram acts as rotation/reflection symmetries of
the roots; it's generated by reflections through the roots. There's a
basis of roots called "simple roots", one for each dot in our Dynkin
diagram, and the product of reflections through all these simple roots
is called the "Coxeter element" of our Coxeter group --- it's
well-defined up to conjugation. The "Coxeter plane" is the canonical
plane on which the Coxeter element acts as a rotation.

A rotation by how much? The order of the Coxeter element is called the
"Coxeter number" and denoted $h$, so the Coxeter element acts on the
Coxeter plane as a rotation of $2\pi/h$. The Coxeter number is important for
other reasons, too! Here's how it goes:

| Coxeter group | Coxeter number |
| :------------ | :------------- |
| $\mathrm{A}_n$ | $n+1$ |
| $\mathrm{B}_n$ | $2n$ |
| $\mathrm{C}_n$ | $2n$ |
| $\mathrm{D}_n$ | $2n-2$ |
| $\mathrm{E}_6$ | $12$ |
| $\mathrm{E}_7$ | $18$ |
| $\mathrm{E}_8$ | $30$ |
| $\mathrm{F}_4$ | $12$ |
| $\mathrm{G}_2$ | $6$ |

For $\mathrm{D}_5$ the Coxeter number is 8, which accounts for the $8$-fold symmetry
of Stembridge's picture in that case. The $\mathrm{E}_8$ picture has $30$-fold
symmetry! My $\mathrm{D}_4$ picture has 8-fold symmetry, so I must not have been
projecting down to the Coxeter plane.

Anyway, this stuff should help answer my puzzle. I don't know the
answer, though.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Addenda:** I thank David Corfield and James Dolan for catching
mistakes. Tony Smith found a nice picture created by G√ºnter Ziegler of
the $\mathrm{D}_4$ root system (that is, the $24$-cell) viewed from the Coxeter
plane. The $\mathrm{D}_4$ root system is $4$-dimensional, but it's been drawn with
a bit of 3d perspective. The 6-fold symmetry is evident:
