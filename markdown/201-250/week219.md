# July 4, 2005 {#week219}

I'm about to head to Sydney and Canberra to help celebrate the 60th
birthday of Ross Street ... the world's best $n$-category theorist!

1) Categories in Algebra, Geometry and Mathematical Physics, conference
in honor of the 60th birthday of Ross Street,
`http://streetfest.maths.mq.edu.au/`

Lots of people will be talking about the interface of higher-dimensional
algebra and physics. Some will be talking about higher gauge theory,
which generalizes ordinary gauge theory from point particles to strings,
loops, or higher-dimensional "branes" by replacing groups with
n-groups.

Ezra Getzler will be speaking on how to get an $n$-group from a Lie
n-algebra, and Mikhail Kapranov will be speaking on higher-dimensional
holonomies. Alissa Crans, Danny Stevenson and I will also be talking
about this stuff.

There will eventually be a conference proceedings, but for now you can
see the abstracts of people's talks on the website. You can see my
talks here:

Anyway, before I take off, here's a roundup of stuff I've been meaning
to mention: the centennial of Einstein's "annus mirabilis", the
Pioneer anomaly, silicon photonics, a company that plans to sell quantum
computers, and some relationships between Klein's quartic curve, the
Fano plane, and special relativity over the integers mod 7. I want to
leave you lots of stuff to think about. :-)

Okay... let's start with Einstein's "annus mirabilis".

1905 was indeed a miraculous year for Albert Einstein. He published four
earth-shaking papers, all in the same journal:

3) Albert Einstein, On a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production
and transformation of light, Annalen der Physik 17 (1905), 132-148.
Available at `http://dbserv.ihep.su/~elan/src/einstein05/eng.pdf`

On the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids
required by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, Annalen der Physik 17
(1905), 549-560. Available at
`http://lorentz.phl.jhu.edu/AnnusMirabilis/AeReserveArticles/eins_brownian.pdf`

On the electrodynamics of moving bodies, Annalen der Physik 17 (1905),
891-921. Available at
`http://dbserv.ihep.su/~elan/src/einstein05b/eng.pdf`

Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?, Annalen der
Physik 18 (1905), 639-641. Available at
`http://dbserv.ihep.su/~elan/src/einstein05c/eng.pdf`

In the first of these papers, Einstein explained the photoelectric
effect by assuming that light consisted of particles each carrying an
energy equal to Planck's constant times its frequency. This was an
important step towards quantum mechanics - a theory he would later fight
against.

In the second, he showed that Brownian motion was explained by the
existence of atoms. His calculations were later used to measure
Boltzmann's constant.

In the third, Einstein derived the formula for Lorentz transformations
from two simple assumptions: only relative motion can be detected, and
every unaccelerated observer measures light to have the same speed.

In the fourth, he derived a relation between mass, momentum, and energy,
including as a special case the famous formula E = mc^2 relating the
mass of a body to its energy at rest.

The most impressive thing about these papers is how simple and readable
they are: they go from clearly stated assumptions to world-shaking
conclusions with clear logic and only a little math.

Which makes one wonder: will there ever be another Einstein? Can one
person ever again make such revolutions in physics? Or are all the
remaining discoveries yet to be made in physics too complicated? Why has
fundamental physics been stuck ever since the completion of the Standard
Model? There are lots of glorious theories, but none of them have gotten
any experimental confirmation. There have also been some big empirical
discoveries - dark matter, dark energy, neutrino oscillations, and more
- but these weren't predicted, and our theories still don't shed much
light on them.

So, are the times ripe for a good new idea... a really smart person who
will fit the jigsaw puzzle together? Or are there still too many missing
pieces?

Lee Smolin has some interesting thoughts about this:

4) Lee Smolin, [Why no "new Einsteins"?](no-new-einstein.pdf),
Physics Today, June 2005, 56-57.

I think the mention of Einstein is mainly just a trick to get people to
read the article. He focuses on institutional pressures that push
physicists to conform: to follow "research programs" in big teams
rather than strike out on their own.

This is certainly a big problem. But I'm not sure it's the only
problem.

Fundamental physics is in a tough situation, partly a victim of its own
success. Pure thought may not be enough. To make real progress, it helps
to have lots of experimental results that don't fit the current
theories. Not just a few numbers here or there, like neutrino masses. We
want *piles* of unexplained data! - enough to draw lots of graphs. Then
we could cook up theories that fit the data.

Barring this, we need to assemble all the mysteries we can get our hands
on, and see if they fit together somehow.

Luckily, right now several spacecraft are leaving the the Solar
System... and they're leaving us with the best of gifts: a mystery!

Pioneer 10 was launched in 1972. It was the first spacecraft to travel
through the asteroid belt, and the first to take closeups photos of
Jupiter, and study the intense magnetic field of this planet. I remember
getting excited about this when I was a kid.

Pioneer 10 was also the first spacecraft to explore the outer solar
system. In 1983 it passed the orbit of Neptune. On February 7th, 2003,
Pioneer 10's radioactive power source weakened to the point where its
radio signals became too feeble to detect. When this happened, it was 80
astronomical units from the Sun: in other words, 80 times as far from
the Sun as we are, or about twice as far out as Pluto.

But this was just the beginning of its cold dark journey. It will
continue to coast through deep space in the general direction of the red
giant Aldebaran, 68 light years from us. A light year is about 63,000
astronomical units, so this journey will take a while: over 2 million
years! We'll probably be long gone by then, for better or worse.

Pioneer 11 was launched in 1973. It followed its sister ship to Jupiter,
then swung past Saturn, and then sailed out into the night, studying the
solar wind as it went. On September 30, 1995 its power source became too
weak to run any more experiments, and NASA stopped monitoring it. It was
45 astronomical units from the Sun, moving out at 2 AU per year.

We are no longer in the beam of its radio signal. Its antenna cannot be
rotated. It is heading towards Aquila - the Eagle - and it will pass one
of the stars in this constellation in 4 million years.

Here's a picture of what these spacecraft are doing:

See how they'll eventually pass through a bubble called the
"termination shock"? That's where the solar wind drops below
supersonic speed as it crashes into the gas of the Milky Way. You can
see a pattern vaguely reminscient of the wave formed by a boat sailing
through the sea - that's because we're moving through the Milky Way.

There are also two other spacecraft in this picture: Voyager 1 and 2!
These craft are still transmitting, and Voyager 1 is now farther than
Pioneer 10. It crossed the termination shock in December 2004, zipping
along at 3.6 AU per year. It's sending back information about this
region of space - called the "heliosheath" - and its batteries should
be good until 2020.

But what's the mystery?

Well, the Pioneer missions yielded the most precise information we have
about navigation in deep space. However, analysis of their radio
tracking data indicates a small unexplained acceleration towards the
Sun! The magnitude of this acceleration is roughly 10^-9^ meters per
second per second. It's called the "Pioneer anomaly".

This anomaly has also been seen in the Ulysses spacecraft, and possibly
also in the Galileo spacecraft, though the data is much more noisy,
since these were Jupiter probes, hence much closer to the Sun, where
there is a lot more pressure from solar radiation. The Voyagers are not
set up to provide good data on this issue, since they are able to rotate
themselves and this messes things up. The Viking mission to Mars did
*not* detect the Pioneer anomaly - and it would have, had an
acceleration of this magnitude been present, because its radio tracking
was incredibly accurate - good to about 12 meters.

Many physicists and astronomers have tried to explain the Pioneer
anomaly using conventional physics, but so far nobody seems to have
succeeded. Radiation pressure from the Sun, the solar wind, the
back-reaction from the radio emissions: all these point the wrong way!
Other explanations also seem to fail, like gravity from the Kuiper belt,
small amounts of gas venting from the spacecraft, and thermal radiation
from the craft,

As conventional explanations seemed to fail, people started trying to
explain the anomaly using new physics - for example, modified theories
of gravity, or dark matter. But it's hard to get these explanations to
work, either. For example, explaining the Pioneer anomaly by the
gravitational attraction of dark matter would require more than .0003
solar masses of dark matter within 50 AU units of the Sun. But this is
in conflict with our highly successful calculations of planetary orbits
- even a millionth of a solar mass of dark matter in this region would
be enough to throw those off!

So, we may have an interesting clue on our hands.

Next: silicon lasers. I don't want to say much about these, just that
Intel thinks they could be the next big thing. You've probably heard
about "Moore's Law", how the number of components in an integrated
circuit doubles every 2 years. Or more vaguely: how computers keeping
getting more powerful, really fast! And you've probably heard that this
exponential growth is in danger of running into a brick wall someday.
One of the problems is that copper wire carries too little data, too
slowly.

For a long time some people have touted "photonics" as the way around
this: transmitting information as pulses of light, rather than clumps of
electrons. One problem is that substances that emit such pulses tend to
be expensive, like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide. But now
they've figured out to make silicon function as a laser! Researchers at
Intel have created a silicon laser that emits a continuous beam of
light. They've also developed a modulator that chops the beam into 10
billion pulses per second - a 10 gigahertz signal.

For details, try this:

While we're talking about high tech, how about quantum computers? Most
of them don't work very well - yet, say the optimists. Interaction with
the environment ruins the coherence of the quantum state. But there's a
company called D-Wave Systems that aims to build a different breed of
quantum computer - one that doesn't mind a fair amount of noise. It's
an analog chip made of lots of superconductors, which is supposed to
quantum tunnel to a lowest-energy state, The idea is that you can get it
to solve lots of minimization problems this way, like the travelling
salesman problem.

I don't see why it'll work better than other analogue computers, or
methods like simulated annealing. It could get stuck when there are lots
of "almost-minima" to sift through... just like glass gets stuck when
it tries to find *its* lowest energy state. Physicists call this
"frustration": the poor glass in your window is "frustrated", trying
to crystallize but unable to decide how to do it. In principle it could
do it by quantum tunnelling, but in practice that takes forever. Why
will D-Wave Systems' computer be better?

By the way, they admit their computer *can't* do cool stuff like
rapidly factor large numbers via Shor's algorithm, the way full-fledged
quantum computers should. True devotees of quantum computation probably
wouldn't even call it a quantum computer! But I'll be happy if it
works.

They've certain managed to convince some investors. Here's some more
info:

But enough practical stuff! Now let me say a bit more about the Klein
quartic.

I wrote about this gadget in ["Week 214"](#week214) and
["Week 215"](#week215). Simply put, this is a "Platonic surface":
a 3-holed torus tiled by regular heptagons, with 3 heptagons meeting at
each vertex.

It's perfectly symmetrical, but you can't stuff it into $3$-dimensional
Euclidean space without warping it. So, its charms are a bit more
esoteric than those of, say, a dodecahedron.

Of course, this is the kind of challenge that some people just can't
resist. Mike Stay and Gerard Westendorp bravely tried making paper
models of it:

14) Gerard Westendorp, Geometry,
`http://www.xs4all.nl/~westy31/Geometry/Geometry.html`

Mike wisely stopped just short of the final step, which would create a
nasty crumpled mess. Gerard succeeded in completing the task by
switching to *pastry* instead of paper. Check it out!

There might be a small niche market for Klein quartic birthday cakes...
but computer graphics are probably better if you just want to visualize
this surface instead of actually eat it. About 10 or 12 years ago, Joe
Christy made the following pictures using a program called Geomview,
which makes virtual 3d objects:

:::

It took about a day on the fastest Linux machine they had at the time.
The advantage of Geomview is that once the virtual object is done, you
can quickly create different views. These pictures show the dual version
of Klein's quartic, which has 7 regular triangles meeting at each
quarter. The funky name "pentacontihexahedron" refers to the fact that
there are 56 of these triangles.

While I'm at it, I can't resist showing you another beautiful picture:

The blue thing is called the "Roman surface" because it was discovered
by the mathematician Jakob Steiner while he was visiting Rome. It's a
self-intersecting immersion of the projective plane in 3d space. On it,
the 7 lines of the Fano plane are visible in red, with four of them
drawn as circles.

Mathematically, one nice thing about this picture is that it exhibits
the tetrahedral symmetry of the Fano plane!

You can see all these pictures and much more on my Klein quartic
website:

`http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/klein.html`

You may think I'm digressing, but the relation between Klein's quartic
curve and the Fano plane underlies what I want to talk about today. Greg
Egan and I realized that this relation is just part of a bigger picture
involving special relativity in $3$-dimensional spacetime... over the
integers mod 7.

Huh?

Well, these days so-called physicists have no shame studying physics in
all sorts of dimensions, but they usually confine themselves to building
their spacetimes out of the real numbers.

That makes sense if they're trying to claim some relevance to
real-world physics, however slight. But mathematically, there's no
reason not to try other number systems, like finite fields, just for the
fun of it.

And this sheds new light on the Klein quartic. Why? Because the
symmetries of the Klein quartic and the Fano plane also act as *Lorentz
transformations* in 3 dimensional spacetime if you work using the
integers mod 7. This lets us see the Klein quartic and Fano plane as
being closely related to special relativity in this funny context.

Let's see how this goes.

First, recall that a "field" is a number system where you can add,
subtract, multiply and divide to your hearts content, with all the basic
laws holding that hold for real numbers. A "finite field" is one with
finitely many elements, like the integers mod any prime number p. This
example is called Z/p, or F~p~ if you really want to emphasize that
you're thinking of it as a field.

So, let's do some 3d special relativity with Z/7, and see what it has
to say about the Klein quartic.

First, some basic stuff about finite fields.

The concepts of "positive" and "negative" make sense in any finite
field! Say a nonzero element of the field is "positive" if it's of
the form x^2 and "negative" otherwise. (Number theorists call the
positive elements "quadratic residues", just to intimidate outsiders.)

Then multiplication works nicely:

-   if you multiply two positive elements you get a positive one;
-   if you multiply two negative elements you get a positive one;
-   if you multiply a positive and a negative element you get a negative
    one.

There are finite fields whose cardinality is any prime power, but if we
focus on those whose cardinality is a prime, namely the fields Z/p,
there are three possibilities: the good, the bad, and the ugly.

-   GOOD: If the field is Z/p for p = 4n+3 then -1 is negative,\
    so we can switch the "sign" of a number by multiplying it by -1.
-   BAD: If the field is Z/p for p = 4n+1 then -1 is positive, so we
    can't do this.

In both these cases there are as many positive as negative elements.
Then there's

-   UGLY: If the field is Z/2 then every element is positive.

Luckily, p = 7 is good. But beware: addition doesn't get along with
positivity very well. In fields like Z/p, *every* element is a sum of
positive elements.

Next, let's ponder the peculiarities of special relativity over a
finite field.

We can define Minkowski spacetime of any dimension over any field F:
it's just F^n+1^ with the quadratic form

x^2 = x~0~^2 - x_1^2 - ... - x_n^2

We define \mathrm{O}(n,1) to be the group of transformations of F^n+1^ that
preserve the above quadratic form, and define the "Lorentz group"
\mathrm{SO}(n,1) to be the subgroup consisting of transformations that also have
determinant 1.

As usual, we say that a vector x in Minkowski spacetime is:

-   timelike if x^2 > 0
-   lightlike if x^2 = 0
-   spacelike if x^2 < 0

We define a "ray" to be a line through the origin. We say a ray is
timelike, spacelike or lightlike if any vector on it - hence all! - is
of that type.

The lightlike rays are usually called "light rays", both because it
sounds cool (we went into physics because we liked things like X-rays
and rayguns) and because it's accurate. The light rays going through a
given point - the origin - are precisely like this.

Next, let's ponder the peculiarities of $3$-dimensional spacetime.

For any field F, 2\times2 matrices with determinant 1 act as Lorentz
transformations of 3d Minkowski spacetime. I touched upon this idea when
discussing Trautman's "Pythagorean spinors" in
["Week 196"](#week196). Here's how it works:

We can think of 3d Minkowski spacetime as consisting of all 2\times2 matrices
that are equal to their own transpose:

        ( x0 + x1       x2   )
    x = (                   )
        (    x2      x0 - x1 )

since the determinant of such a matrix is just

    x2 = x02 - x12 - x22

In this picture, the group \mathrm{SL}(2,F) consisting of 2\times2 matrices with
determinant 1 acts as Lorentz transformations:

g: x \mapsto gxg*

where g* is the transpose of g. So, we get a homomorphism from \mathrm{SL}(2,F)
to the 3d Lorentz group:

\mathrm{SL}(2,F) \to \mathrm{SO}(2,1)

This is two-to-one, since it sends both 1 and -1 to the identity Lorentz
transformation. People typically cure this by defining

\mathrm{PSL}(2,F) = \mathrm{SL}(2,F)/{+-1}

We then get a one-to-one homomorphism

\mathrm{PSL}(2,F) \to \mathrm{SO}(2,1)

Alas, this homomorphism is not onto: it's only "half-onto". In the
traditional case where F is the real numbers, its range is just one of
the two connected components of \mathrm{SO}(2,1). In the case we're interested
in here, where F = Z/7, the group \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}/7) has 168 elements but
\mathrm{SO}(2,1) has twice as many.

Next, let's bring the hyperbolic plane into the game!

Special relativity in 3 dimensions is closely related to the hyperbolic
plane. The reason is that the set of timelike rays in $(n+1)$-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime forms a copy of hyperbolic $n$-space: physicists call
this the "mass hyperboloid". So, for n = 2, we get the hyperbolic
plane. This is most familiar for special relativity based on the real
numbers, but the same idea applies to other fields.

So, let's make some definitions:

-   the hyperbolic plane H+ is the set of timelike rays in 3d Minkowski
    spacetime
-   the heavenly circle L is the set of light rays in 3d Minkowski
    spacetime
-   the hyperbolic cylinder H- is the set of spacelike rays in 3d
    Minkowski spacetime

You may think I'm being silly to call the set of light rays "the
heavenly circle", but in $4$-dimensional spacetime the analogous thing is
often called "the heavenly sphere", and we're studying things one
dimension down.

Why "heavenly sphere"? Well, when you look at the stars at night, they
seem to be lying on a sphere. That's the heavenly sphere: the set of
light rays entering your eye - the set of directions you can look!

One dimension down, flatlanders get to enjoy the "heavenly circle".
Mathematicians call this the projective line, since it's a line with
one extra point added on.

Now for something fun: points on the hyperbolic plane give lines on the
hyperbolic cylinder and vice versa!

This is basically by definition of "line". We define a "line" in H+
to consist of all points that are orthogonal to a given point in H-, and
vice versa. Note a point in either of these spaces is really a ray in
Minkowski spacetime, but it makes sense to say that two rays are
orthogonal.

This definition isn't arbitrary: it reduces to a standard notion of
"line" in the hyperbolic plane - namely a geodesic - when our field is
the real numbers.

Finally, let's dive into the case we're really interested in:
3-dimensional Minkowski spacetime over F = Z/7.

In this case the positive numbers are 1,2,4, and the negative numbers
are 3,5,6.

It turns out that:

-   The hyperbolic plane over Z/7, namely H+, has size 21.
-   The heavenly circle over Z/7, namely L, has size 8.
-   The hyperbolic cylinder over Z/7, namely H-, has size 28.

So, H+ is a nice finite version of the hyperbolic plane with 21 points
and 28 lines! A little calculation shows there are 3 points on each line
and 4 lines through each point.

We know that \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}/7) acts on everything in sight here: H+, H-, and L.
It also acts on the Fano plane and Klein's quartic curve. So, we can
try to match up various features of 3d special relativity with features
in the Fano plane or Klein's quartic curve!

Greg Egan found the following correspondence:

    HYPERBOLIC PLANE OVER Z/7                      FANO PLANE    

    7 triads                                       7 points  
    7 antitriads                                   7 lines       
    21 points                                      21 flags     
    28 lines                                       28 apartments 

As usual with these correspondences, simple things in the Fano plane
correspond to subtle things in the hyperbolic plane, and simple things
in the hyperbolic plane correspond to subtle things in the Fano plane.

First of all, points and lines in the Fano plane correspond to
"triads" and "antitriads" in H+.

Huh?

Well, for starters, a "triad" or "antitriad" is an unordered triple
of orthogonal points in H+.

Huh?

Well, remember that a point in H+ is a timelike ray in 3d Minkowski
spacetime. You can't have three timelike rays that are orthogonal in
ordinary special relativity, but you can over Z/7, because the sum of
postive numbers can be zero, or even negative. For example, these three
vectors are timelike and orthogonal:

(1,0,0),   (0,4,2),   (0,-2,4)

We call the corresponding triple of rays a "triad", and we get a total
of 7 triads by applying elements of \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}/7) to it. But, there are
triples of orthogonal timelike rays that aren't among these 7. For
example, we get one from these three vectors:

(1,0,0),   (0,2,4),   (0,-4,2)

We call the corresponding triple of rays an "antitriad", and we get 7
antitriads by applying elements of \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}/7).

Each line in the Fano plane contains 3 points, and each point lies on 3
lines. This incidence relation can also be seen in terms of triads and
antitriads: each triad has nonempty intersection with 3 antitriads, and
each antitriad has nonempty intersection with 3 triads!

We can also go backwards: points and lines in the hyperbolic plane
correspond to "flags" and "apartments" in the Fano plane.

Huh?

Flags and apartments are standard concepts in the theory of
"buildings" which I began to explain in ["Week 186"](#week186).
But, I don't want or need to explain this general theory here. In the
Fano plane, a "flag" consists of a point lying on a line:

                      
                        --------x---------

An "apartment" consists of 3 distinct points lying on 3 distinct lines
like this:

                           \           /
                            \         /
                       ------x-------x-----
                              \     /
                               \   /
                                \ /
                                 x
                                / \
                               /   \

Each apartment in the Fano plane contains 3 flags, and each flag is
contained in 4 apartments. This incidence can also been seen in terms of
points and lines in the hyperbolic plane: each line contains 3 points,
and each point lies on 4 lines!

So, there's an interesting but complicated relation between hyperbolic
geometry over Z/7 and the Fano plane. How does the Klein quartic curve
fit in? There's more to this side of the story than I've managed to
absorb, so I'll just say a few words - probably more than you want to
hear. For more detail, try my Klein quartic curve webpage.

There are 48 nonzero lightlike vectors in 3d Minkowksi spacetime, but if
you take one of them and apply elements of \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}/7) to it, you get an
orbit consisting of only 24. These 24 guys correspond to the 24
heptagons in the heptagonal tiling of the Klein quartic curve! In other
words, \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}/7) acts in precisely the same way.

You may ask what the point of all this stuff is, and the answer is -
I'm not sure yet, except that it's fun! Apparently the coincidence

\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z}/7) = \mathrm{PSL}(3,Z/2)

is the only coincidence among classical groups over finite fields, not
counting the ones we already know over the real numbers. So, it's got
to be good for something! And, I haven't even begun to exploit the fact
that the Klein quartic curve is a quotient space of the real hyperbolic
plane: this has got to be related to the hyperbolic plane over Z/7. So,
I think something interesting should emerge, though I'm not sure what.
