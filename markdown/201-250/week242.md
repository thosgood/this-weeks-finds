# December 17, 2006 {#week242}

This week I'd like to talk about a paper by Jeffrey Morton. Jeff is a
grad student now working with me on topological quantum field theory and
higher categories. I've already mentioned his work on categorified
algebra and quantum mechanics in ["Week 236"](#week236). He'll be
be finishing his Ph.D. thesis in the spring of 2007 --- and as usual, that
means he's already busy applying for jobs.

As all you grad students reading this know, applying for jobs is pretty
scary the first time around: there are some tricks involved, and nobody
prepares you for it. I remember myself, wondering what I'd do if I
didn't succeed. Would I have to sell ice cream from one of those trucks
that plays a little tune as it drives around the neighborhood? A job in
the financial industry seemed scarcely more appealing: less time to
think about math, and less ice cream too.

Luckily things worked out for me... and I'm sure they'll work out for
Jeff and my other student finishing up this year --- Derek Wise, who is
working on Cartan geometry and MacDowell-Mansouri gravity.

But, to help them out a bit, I'd like to talk about their work. This
has been high on my list of interests for the last few years, of course,
but I've mostly been keeping it under wraps.

This time I'll talk about Jeff's thesis; next time Derek's. But
first, let's start with some cool astronomy pictures!

Here's a photo of Saturn, Saturn's rings, and its moon Dione, taken by
the Cassini orbiter in October last year:
$$\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/dione_ring.jpg}$$

1) NASA, "Ringside with Dione", `http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=4163`

It's so vivid it seems like a composite fake, but it's not! With the
Sun shining from below, delicate shadows of the B and C rings cover
Saturn's northern hemisphere. Dione seems to hover nearby. Actually
it's 39,000 kilometers away in this photo. It's 1,200 kilometers in
diameter, about the third the size of our Moon.

Here's a photo of Saturn, its rings, and its moon Mimas, taken in
November 2004:
$$\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/mimas_ring_big.jpg}$$

2) NASA, "Nature's canvas", `http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/image-details.cfm?imageID=1088`

It's gorgeous, but it takes some work to figure out what's going on!

The blue stuff in the background is Saturn, with lines created by
shadows of rings. The bright blue-white stripe near Mimas is sunlight
shining through a break in the rings called the "Cassini division".
The brownish stuff near the bottom is the A ring --- you can see right
through it. Above it there's a break and a thinner ring called the F
ring. Below it is the Cassini division itself.

This is just one of many photos taken by Cassini and Huyghens, the probe
that Cassini dropped onto Saturn's moon Titan --- see
["Week 210"](#week210) for more on that. You can see more of these
photos here:

3) NASA, "Cassini-Huygens", `http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/`

I hope you see from these beautiful images, and others on This Week's
Finds, that we are *already in space*. We don't need people up there
for us to effectively *be there*.

Alas, not everyone recognizes this. An expensive American program to set
up a base on the Moon, perhaps as a stepping stone to a manned mission
to Mars, is starting to drain money from more exciting unmanned
missions. NASA guesses this program will cost \$104 billion up to the
time when we land on the Moon --- again --- in 2020. By 2024, the Government
Accounting Office guesses the price will be \$230 billion. By
comparison, the Cassini-Huygens mission cost just about \$3.3 billion.

And what will be benefits of a Moon base be? It's unclear: at best,
some vague dream of "space colonization".

Mind you, I'm in favor of space exploration, and even colonization.
But, these are very different things!

Colonies are usually about making money. Governments support them in
hopes of turning a profit: think Columbus and Isabella, or other
adventurers funded by colonial powers.

Right now most of the money lies in near-earth orbit, not on the Moon
and Mars. Telecommunication satellites and satellite photos are
established businesses. The next step may be tourism. Dennis Tito,
Gregory Olsen and Mark Shuttleworth have already paid the Russian
government \$20 million each to visit the International Space Station.
This orbits at an altitude of about 350 kilometers, in the upper
"thermosphere" --- the layer of the Earth's atmosphere where gases get
ionized by solar radiation.

If this is too pricey for you, wait a few years. Richard Branson's
company Virgin Galactic plans to give 500 people per year a 7-minute
experience of weightlessness at a cost of just \$200,000 each. Alas,
you'll only go up 100 kilometers, near the bottom of the thermosphere.

Some competition may lower the price. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon,
has bought a lot of land in Texas to a build space port for his company
Blue Origins. He wants to do test flights by next year, and he
eventually wants 50 flights a year in a vehicle that holds 3. If you've
always looked forward to using your seat cushion as a flotation device
in the event of a water landing, you'll love this:

> "During an abort situation, the crew capsule would separate, using
> small solid-rocket motors to safely recover the space flight
> participants. The abort module containing the solid-rocket motors
> would then jettison from the crew capsule."

None of this stuff requires any taxpayer funding. It's a bit
self-indulgent and silly, but it may eventually grow and merge with
other profit-making forms of space colonization.

Exploration is a bit different: seeing what's out there, mainly for the
sake of adventure and understanding. For this we should send machines,
not people. Machines can be designed to do well in vacuum. People can't
- not yet. This will probably change when nanotech, AI and cyborg
technologies kick in. But for now, unmanned probes are the way to go.

Here are some of the wonderful things we could do, all for less than
setting up a Moon base:

4) The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), [http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/](http://lisa.jpl.nasa.gov/)

The idea of LISA is to put 3 satellites in a huge equilateral triangle
following the Earth in its orbit around the Sun, and bounce lasers
between them to detect gravitational waves (see
["Week 143"](#week143)):
$$\href{http://lisa.jpl.nasa.gov/STRATEGY/getThere.html}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/LISA_orbit.png}}$$
This would avoid the ground noise that plagues LIGO (see
["Week 241"](#week241)), and it could detect waves of much lower
frequencies. If all works well, it could see gravitational waves from
the *very* early Universe, long before the hot gas enough cooled to let
light through. We're talking times like $10^{-38} seconds after the Big
Bang! That's the biggest adventure I can imagine... back to the birth
pangs of the Universe.

Right now LISA is scheduled for launch around 2016. But as you'll soon
see, this may not happen.

5) Constellation-X, [http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

This would be a team of X-ray telescopes, combining forces to be 100
times more powerful than any previous single one. Among many other
things, Constellation-X could study the X-rays emitted by matter falling
into things that look like black holes. The redshift of these X-rays is
our best test of general relativity for very strong gravitational
fields. So, it's our best way of checking that these black hole
candidates really do have event horizons!

In February 2006, when NASA put out their latest budget, they said
Constellation-X would be "delayed indefinitely". And in September
2006, a National Research Council committee was formed to pick *one* of
NASA's five "Beyond Einstein" programs for the first shot at funding:
LISA, Constellation-X, the Joint Dark Energy Mission, the Inflation
Probe and the Black Hole Finder. Currently the Joint Dark Energy Mission
seems to be in the lead:

6) Steinn Sigurðsson, "NASA: double down on science", Dynamics of Cats, September 16, 2006, `http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2006/09/nasa_double_down_on_science.php`

A decision is expected around September 2007.

7) The Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), `http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/`

This could study Earth-like planets orbiting stars up to 45 light years
away. It would consist of two observatories: a visible-light
"coronagraph" that blocks out the light from a star so it can see
nearby fainter objects:
$$\href{http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/tpf_coronagraph.jpg}}$$
and an infrared interferometer made of several units flying in
formation:
$$\href{http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/tpf_formation_flying_infrared_interferometer.jpg}}$$
In February 2006, NASA halted work on the TPF. In June 2006, thanks to
public pressure, Congress reinstated funding for this program and also a
mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, which could have oceans underneath
its icy crust. However, at last report, NASA was continuing to fight
*against* reinstating these missions:

8) Louis D. Friedman, "Congressional inaction leaves science still devastated", _The Planetary Society_, November 26, 2006, `http://planetary.org/programs/projects/sos/20061122.html`

The constantly shifting situation makes it hard to know what's going
on.

9) The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuStar), `http://www.nustar.caltech.edu/`

This is an orbiting observatory with three telescopes, designed to see
hard X-rays. It could conduct a thorough survey of black hole candidates
throughout the universe. It could study relativistic jets of particles
from the cores of active galaxies (which are probably also black holes).
And, it could study young supernova remnants --- hot new neutron stars.

NASA suddenly canceled work on NuStar in February 2006.

10) Dawn, `http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/`

The Dawn mission seeks to understand the early Solar System by probing
the asteroid belt and taking a good look at Ceres and Vesta.
[Ceres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29) is the
largest asteroid of all, 950 kilometers in diameter. It seems have a
rocky core, a thick mantle of water ice, and a thin dusty outer crust.
[Vesta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta) is the second largest,
about 530 kilometers in diameter. It's very different from Ceres: it's
not round, and it's all rock. A certain group of stony meteorites
called "[HED meteorites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HED_meteorite)"
are believed to be pieces of Vesta!

NASA cancelled the Dawn mission in March 2006 --- but later that month,
they changed their minds.

It's depressing to contemplate all the wonderful things we could miss
while spending hundreds of billions to "send canned primates to Mars",
as Charles Stross so cleverly put it in his novel "Accelerando" (see
["Week 222"](#week222)). I'm all for humanity spreading through
space. I just don't think we should do it in a clunky, low-tech way
like setting up a base on the Moon where astronauts sit around and...
what, play golf? It's like something out of old science fiction!

To cheer myself up again, here's a picture of the Sun:
$$\href{http://cosmicvariance.com/2006/10/13/sun-shots/}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/sun_neutrinos.jpg}}$$

11) Joanne Hewett, "Sun Shots", `http://cosmicvariance.com/2006/10/13/sun-shots/`

It was taken not with light, but with *neutrinos*. It was made at the
big neutrino observatory in Japan, called Super-Kamiokande. It took
about 504 days and nights to make.

That's right --- nights! Neutrinos go right through the Earth.

As you probably know, neutrinos oscillate between three different kinds,
but only electron neutrinos are easy to detect, so we see about third as
many neutrinos from the Sun as naively expected. That's the kind of
thing they're studying at Super-Kamiokande.

But what I want to know is: what's the "glare" in this picture?
Neutrinos are made by the process of fusion, which involves this
reaction:
$$\mathrm{proton} + \mathrm{electron} \to \mathrm{neutron} + \mathrm{electron neutrino}$$
Fusion mostly happens in the Sun's core, which has a density of 160
grams per cubic centimeter (10 times denser than lead) and a temperature
of 15 million kelvin (300 thousand times hotter than the "broil"
setting on an American oven).

So, what's the disk in this picture: the whole Sun, or the Sun's core?
And what's the glare?

Okay, now for some serious mathematical physics:

12) Jeffrey Morton, "A double bicategory of cobordisms with corners", available as [`math.CT/0611930v1`](http://arXiv.org/abs/math.CT/0611930v1).

People have been talking a long time about topological quantum field
theory and higher categories. The idea is that categories, $2$-categories,
3-categories and the like can describe how manifolds can be chopped into
little pieces --- or more precisely, how these little pieces can be glued
together to form manifolds. Then the problem of doing quantum field
theory on some manifold can be reduced to the problem of doing it on
these pieces and gluing the results together. This works easiest if the
theory is "topological", not requiring a background metric.

There's a lot of evidence that this is a good idea, but getting the
details straight has proved tough, even at the $2$-category level. This is
what Morton does, in a rather clever way. Very roughly, his idea is to
use something I'll call a "weak double category", and prove that
these:

- $(n-2)$-dimensional manifolds
- $(n-1)$-dimensional manifolds with boundary
- $n$-dimensional manifolds with corners

give a weak double category called $n\mathsf{Cob}_2$. The proof is a cool mix of
topology and higher category theory. He then shows that this particular
weak double category can be reinterpreted as something a bit more
familiar --- a "weak $2$-category".

In the rest of his thesis, Jeff will use this formalism to construct
some examples of "extended TQFTs", which are roughly maps of weak
$2$-categories
$$Z\colon n\mathsf{Cob}_2 \to 2\mathsf{Vect}$$
where $2\mathsf{Vect}$ is the weak $2$-category of "$2$-vector spaces". He's
focusing on some extended TQFTs called the Dijkgraaf-Witten models,
coming from finite groups.

But, he's also thought about the case where the finite group is
replaced by a compact Lie group. In this case we get something called BF
theory, which is a lot like an extended TQFT, but not quite, because
there are some divergences (infinities) that arise. In this case of 3d
spacetime with the Lie group $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, $BF$ theory gives a nice theory of
quantum gravity called the Ponzano-Regge model. And, as I hinted back in
["Week 232"](#week232), we can let 2d space in this model be a
manifold with *boundary* by poking little holes in space. Then these
holes wind up acting like particles!

So, we get a relation like this:

|    |    |
| :- | :- |
| $(n-2)$-dimensional manifolds | **matter** |
| $(n-1)$-dimensional manifolds with boundary | **space** |
| $n$-dimensional manifolds with corners | **spacetime** |

I like this a lot: it reminds me of the title of Weyl's famous book
"Raum, Zeit, Materie", meaning "Space, Time, Matter". He never
guessed this trio was related to the objects, morphisms and $2$-morphisms
in a weak $2$-category! It's too bad we can't seem to get something like
this to work for full-fledged quantum gravity.

It would be fun to talk more about this. However, to understand
Morton's work more deeply, you need to understand a bit about "weak
double categories". He explains them quite nicely, but I think I'll
spend the rest of this Week's Finds giving a less detailed
introduction, just to get you warmed up.

This chart should help:

|    | **Bigons** | **Squares** |
| :- | :----: | :-----: |
| **Laws holding as equations** | strict $2$-categories | strict double categories |
| **Laws holding up to isomorphism** | weak $2$-categories | weak double categories |

$2$-categories are good for describing how to glue together $2$-dimensional
things that, at least in some abstract sense, are shaped like *bigons*.
A "bigon" is a disc with its boundary divided into two halves:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=left:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=right:{$Y$}] (y) at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[dashed] (x) to (y);
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]above:{\scriptsize$f$}}]{} controls (0.7,1) and (1.3,1) .. (y);
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]below:{\scriptsize$g$}}]{}controls (0.7,-1) and (1.3,-1) .. (y);
    \draw[double,double equal sign distance,-implies] (1,0.5) to (1,-0.5);
    \node at (1.2,0.3) {\scriptsize$B$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
The big arrow indicates that we think of the bigon $B$ as "going from"
the top semicircle, $f$, to the bottom semicircle, $g$. Similarly, we think
of the arcs $f$ and $g$ as going from the point $X$ to the point $Y$.

Similarly, double categories are good for describing how to glue
together $2$-dimensional gadgets that are shaped like *squares*:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label={[label distance=-3mm]above left:{$X$}}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label={[label distance=-3mm]above right:{$X'$}}] (x') at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label={[label distance=-3mm]below left:{$Y$}}] (y) at (0,-2) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label={[label distance=-3mm]below right:{$Y'$}}] (y') at (2,-2) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[->] (x) to node[label=above:{$f$}]{} (x');
    \draw[->] (x) to node[label=left:{$g$}]{} (y);
    \draw[->] (x') to node[label=right:{$g'$}]{} (y');
    \draw[->] (y) to node[label=below:{$f'$}]{} (y');
    \node at (1,-1) {$S$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
Both $2$-categories and double categories come in "strict" and "weak"
versions. The strict versions have operations satisfying a bunch of laws
"on the nose", as equations. In the weak versions, these laws hold up
to isomorphism whenever possible.

A few more details might help....

A $2$-category has a set of objects, a set of morphisms $f\colon X \to Y$ going
from any object $X$ to to any object $Y$, and a set of $2$-morphisms
$T\colon f \Rightarrow g$ going from any morphism $f: X \to Y$ to
any morphism $g\colon X \to Y$. We can
visualize the objects as dots:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=below:{$X$}] at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
the morphisms as arrows:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=left:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=right:{$Y$}] (y) at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[->] (x) to node[label=above:{$f$}]{} (y);
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
and the $2$-morphisms as bigons:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=left:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=right:{$Y$}] (y) at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[dashed] (x) to (y);
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]above:{\scriptsize$f$}}]{} controls (0.7,1) and (1.3,1) .. (y);
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]below:{\scriptsize$g$}}]{}controls (0.7,-1) and (1.3,-1) .. (y);
    \draw[double,double equal sign distance,-implies] (1,0.5) to (1,-0.5);
    \node at (1.2,0.3) {\scriptsize$B$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
We can compose morphisms like this:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=below:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=below:{$Y$}] (y) at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=below:{$Z$}] (z) at (4,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[->] (x) to node[label=above:{$f$}]{} (y);
    \draw[->] (y) to node[label=above:{$g$}]{} (z);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \qquad
  \raisebox{2em}{\text{gives}}
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=below:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=below:{$Z$}] (z) at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[->] (x) to node[label=above:{$fg$}]{} (z);
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
We can also compose $2$-morphisms vertically:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=1.2]
    \node[label=left:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=right:{$Y$}] (y) at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[->] (x) to (y);
    \node at (0.6,0.15) {\scriptsize$g$};
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]above:{\scriptsize$f$}}]{} controls (0.7,1) and (1.3,1) .. (y);
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]below:{\scriptsize$h$}}]{}controls (0.7,-1) and (1.3,-1) .. (y);
    \draw[double,double equal sign distance,-implies] (1,0.7) to (1,0.05);
    \node at (1.2,0.4) {\scriptsize$S$};
    \draw[double,double equal sign distance,-implies] (1,-0.05) to (1,-0.7);
    \node at (1.2,-0.3) {\scriptsize$T$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \qquad
  \raisebox{3.65em}{\text{gives}}
  \qquad
  \begin{tikzpicture}[yscale=1.2]
    \node[label=left:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=right:{$Y$}] (y) at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[dashed] (x) to (y);
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]above:{\scriptsize$f$}}]{} controls (0.7,1) and (1.3,1) .. (y);
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]below:{\scriptsize$h$}}]{}controls (0.7,-1) and (1.3,-1) .. (y);
    \draw[double,double equal sign distance,-implies] (1,0.5) to (1,-0.5);
    \node at (1.2,0.3) {\scriptsize$ST$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
and horizontally:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=left:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node (y) at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node at (2.05,0.3) {$Y$};
    \node[label=right:{$Z$}] (z) at (4,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[->] (x) .. node[label={[label distance=-1mm]above:{\scriptsize$f$}}]{} controls (0.7,1) and (1.3,1) .. (y);

    \node at (3.2,0.3) {\scriptsize$T$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \qquad
  \raisebox{3.5em}{\text{gives}}
  \qquad

    \draw[double,double equal sign distance,-implies] (1.5,0.5) to (1.5,-0.5);
    \node at (1.9,0.3) {\scriptsize$S\cdot T$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
There are also a bunch of laws that need to hold. I don't want to list
them; you can find them in Jeff's paper (also see
["Week 80"](#week80)). I just want to emphasize how a strict
$2$-category is different from a weak one.

In a strict $2$-category, the composition of morphisms is associative on
the nose:
$$(fg)h = f(gh)$$
and there are identity morphisms that satisfy these laws on the nose:
$$1f = f = f1$$
In a weak $2$-category, these equations are replaced by 2-isomorphisms ---
that is, invertible $2$-morphisms. And, these 2-isomorphisms need to
satisfy new equations of their own!

What about double categories?

Double categories are like $2$-categories, but instead of bigons, we have
squares.

More precisely, a double category has a set of objects:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=below:{$X$}] at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
a set of horizontal arrows:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=left:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=right:{$X'$}] (x') at (2,0) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[->] (x) to node[label=above:{$f$}]{} (x');
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
a set of vertical arrows:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label=left:{$X$}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};
    \node[label=left:{$Y$}] (y) at (0,-2) {$\bullet$};
    \draw[->] (x) to node[label=left:{$g$}]{} (y);
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
and a set of squares:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[label={[label distance=-3mm]above left:{$X$}}] (x) at (0,0) {$\bullet$};

We can compose the horizontal arrows like this:

We can compose the vertical arrows like this:

In a strict double category, both vertical and horizontal composition of
morphisms is associative on the nose:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    (fg)h &= f(gh)
  \\(f\cdot g)\cdot h &= f\cdot (g\cdot h)
  \end{aligned}
$$
and there are identity morphisms for both vertical and horizontal
composition, which satisfy the usual identity laws on the nose.

In a weak double category, we want these laws to hold only up to
isomorphism. But, it turns out that this requires us to introduce bigons
as well! The reason is fascinating but too subtle to explain here. I
didn't understand it until Jeff pointed it out. But, it turns out that
Dominic Verity had already introduced the right concept of weak double
category --- a gadget with both squares and bigons --- in *his* Ph.D. thesis
a while back:

13) Dominic Verity, _Enriched categories, internal categories, and change of base_, Ph.D. dissertation, University of Cambridge, 1992.

Interestingly, if you weaken *only* the laws for vertical composition,
you don't need to introduce bigons. The resulting concept of
"horizontally weak double category" has been studied by Grandis and
Pare:

    Marco Grandis and Bob Paré, "Adjoints for double categories", _Cah. Top. Geom. Diff. Cat._ **45** (2004), 193--240. Also available at `http://www.dima.unige.it/~grandis/Dbl.Adj.pdf`

and more recently by Martin Hyland's student Richard Garner:

15) Richard Garner, "Double clubs", available as [`math.CT/0606733`](https://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0606733)

and Tom Fiore:

16) Thomas M. Fiore, "Pseudo algebras and pseudo double categories", available as [`math.CT./0608760`](https://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0608760).

At this point I should admit that the terminology in this whole field is
a bit of a mess. I've made up simplified terminology for the purposes
of this article, but now I should explain how it maps to the terminology
most people use:

| ME | THEM |
| :- | :--- |
| strict $2$-category | $2$-category |
| weak $2$-category | bicategory |
| strict double category | double category |
| weak double category | double bicategory |
| horizontally weak double category | pseudo double category |

Verity used the term "double bicategory" to hint that his gadgets have
both squares and bigons, so they're like a blend of double categories
and bicategories. It's a slightly unfortunate term, since experts know
that a double category is a category object in $\mathsf{Cat}$, but Verity's double
bicategories are not bicategory objects in $\mathsf{BiCat}$. Morton mainly uses
Verity's double bicategories --- but in the proof of his big theorem, he
also uses bicategory objects in $\mathsf{BiCat}$.

There's a lot more to say, but I'll stop here and let you read the
rest in Jeff's paper!

**Addenda:** I thank Charlie Clingen for catching some typos in my
diagrams, and Nathan Urban and Torbjörn Larsson for helping me update
some of my information on the funding of NASA programs. I won't attempt
to keep this information up to date, since it's changing too often.
But, I'd like to it be correct as of the date I wrote it!

I've deleted the word "probably". According to a comment on Joanne
Hewett's blog entry, each pixel in the neutrino picture of the Sun is
one degree in size. The Sun itself is just half a degree wide.
