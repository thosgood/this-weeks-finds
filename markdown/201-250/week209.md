# November 21, 2004 {#week209}

Time flies! This June, Peter May and I organized a workshop on
$n$-categories at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications:

1) $n$-Categories: Foundations and Applications,
`http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/`

I've been meaning to write about it ever since, but I keep putting it
off because it would be so much work. The meeting lasted almost two
weeks. It was an intense, exhausting affair packed with talks,
conversations, and "Russian-style seminars" where the audience
interrupted the speakers with lots of questions. I took about 50 pages
of notes. How am I supposed to describe all that?!

Oh well... I'll just dive in. I'll quickly list all the official
talks in this conference. I won't describe the many interesting
"impromptu talks", some of which you can see on the above webpage. Nor
will I explain what $n$-categories are, or what they're good for! If you
want to learn what they're good for, you should go back to
["Week 73"](#week73) and read "The Tale of $n$-Categories". And if
you want to know what they *are*, try this brand-new book:

2) Eugenia Cheng and Aaron Lauda, Higher-Dimensional Categories: an
Illustrated Guide Book, available free online at:
`http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~elgc2/guidebook/`

Eugenia and Aaron wrote it specially for the workshop! It's packed with
pictures and it's lots of fun.

I'm just going to list the talks....

Throwing etiquette to the winds, I kicked off the conference myself with
two talks explaining some reasons why $n$-categories are interesting and
what they should be like:

3) John Baez, Why $n$-Categories? and What $n$-categories should be like.
Notes available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#mon`

If you're a long-time reader of This Week's Finds you'll know what I
said: $n$-categories give a new world of math in which equations are
always replaced by isomorphisms, and this world is incredibly rich in
structure. The $n$-categories called "n-groupoids" magically know
everything there is to know about homotopy theory, while those called
"$n$-categories with duals" know everything there is to know about the
topology of manifolds. There are, unfortunately, some details that still
need to be worked out!

After my talks there was a reception. Later, over dinner, Tom Leinster
gave a "Russian style seminar" outlining the different approaches to
$n$-categories:

4) Tom Leinster, Survey and Taxonomy. Talk based on chapter 10 of his
book Higher Operads, Higher Categories, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge,
2004, also available free online at
[math.CT/0305049](http://www.arXiv.org/abs/math.CT/0305049).

You'll notice these young $n$-category people are smart: they force their
publishers to keep their books available for free online! All scientists
should do this, since the only people who make serious money from
scientific monographs are the publishers. What scientists get from
writing technical books is not money but attention. As George Franck
said, "Attention is a mode of payment... reputation is the asset into
which the attention received from colleagues crystallizes."

The next morning began with a triple-header talk on "weak categories":

5) Andre Joyal, Peter May and Timothy Porter, Weak categories. Notes
available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#tues`

Here a "weak category" means a category where the usual laws hold only
up to homotopy, where the homotopies satisfy laws of their own up to
homotopy, ad infinitum. If you know what weak \infty-categories are, you can
define a weak category to be one of these where all the j-morphisms are
equivalences for j > 1. But, the nice thing is that there are ways to
define weak categories without the full machinery of \infty-categories!
People have come up with different approaches: "categories enriched
over simplicial sets", "Segal categories", "A\_\infty categories" and
also Joyal's "quasicategories". The talk was a nice introduction to
all these approaches.

Then Michael Batanin explained his definition of \infty-categories. This was
a blackboard talk, so there are no notes on the web, but you can try his
original paper:

6) Michael Batanin, Monoidal globular categories as natural environment
for the theory of weak $n$-categories, Adv. Math. 136 (1998), 39-103, also
available at `http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~mbatanin/papers.html`

and when you get stuck, try the books by Cheng-Lauda and Leinster.

Over dinner, Eugenia Cheng and Tom Leinster explained the concepts of
"operad" and "multicategory" which play such an important role in so
much work on $n$-categories. Again there are no notes, so try their books.

I forget when it happened, but sometime around the second or third day
of the conference people decided it was too much of a nuisance listening
to math lectures while eating dinner - mainly because there wasn't
enough room in the dining hall to take notes, and the blackboards
weren't big enough. So at that point, we switched to having lectures
*after* dinner. As I said, this workshop was not for wimps!

The morning of the third day began with a no-holds-barred minicourse on
model categories by Peter May:

7) Peter May, Model categories. Notes available at
`http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#wed`

Model categories are a wonderful framework for relating different
approaches to homotopy theory, and a bunch of people hope they can also
be used to relate different approaches to $n$-categories.

Then Clemens Berger explained Andre Joyal's approach to weak
$n$-categories:

8) Clemens Berger, Cellular definitions. Notes available at
`http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#wed`

Then, either during or after dinner, Eugenia Cheng explained various
"opetopic" approaches to weak $n$-categories. Again, the best way to
learn about these is to read the book she wrote with Lauda, or else the
book by Leinster.

On the morning of the fourth day, Andre Joyal explained his work on
quasicategories - an approach to weak categories in which they are
simplicial sets satisfying a restricted version of the Kan condition.
They've been around a long time, but Joyal is redoing all of category
theory in this context! He's been writing a book about this, which
deserves to be called "Quasicategories for the Working Mathematician".
Since Joyal is a perfectionist, this will take forever to finish.
However, we're hoping to extract a preliminary version from him for the
proceedings of this conference. For now, you can read a bit about
quasicategories in Tim Porter's notes mentioned in item 5) above.

Then Tom Leinster and Nick Gurski spoke about Ross Street's definition
to weak \infty-categories, where they are simplicial sets satisfying an even
more subtly restricted version of the Kan condition.

9) Nick Gurski and Tom Leinster, Simplicial definition. Notes available
at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#thur`

Street's definition is tough to understand at first, but it should
eventually include Joyal's quasicategories as a special case, which is
nice. For Street's own discussion, see:

It relies on some work by Dominic Verity which has finally been written
up after many years of unpublished limbo:

11) Dominic Verity, Complicial sets, available as
[math.CT/0410412](http://www.arXiv.org/abs/math.CT/0410412)

After dinner we took a turn towards applications, and Larry Breen
explained his work on $n$-stacks and $n$-gerbes. An $n$-stack is like a sheaf
that has an $(n-1)$-category of sections, while an $n$-gerbe has an
(n-1)-groupoid of sections. Such things show up a lot in algebraic
geometry, and more recently in mathematical physics inspired by string
theory. Alas, the audience was rather tired this evening, so Larry only
got to 1-stacks and 1-gerbes! But he gave an impromptu talk later where
he reached n = 2, and the notes for both talks are available in combined
form here:

12) Larry Breen, $n$-Stacks and $n$-gerbes: homotopy theory. Notes
available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#thur`

You've heard about David Corfield's quest for a philosophy of real
mathematics in ["Week 198"](#week198). He's one of the few
philosophers who understands enough math to realize how cool
$n$-categories are - which may explain why he's having trouble getting a
job. On the morning of the fourth day, he gave a talk on the impact
$n$-categories could have in philosophy:

13) David Corfield, $n$-Category theory as a catalyst for change in
philosophy. Notes available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#fri`

Later that day, Bertrand Toen explained Segal categories, which are
another popular approach to weak categories:

14) Bertrand Toen, Segal categories. Notes by Joachim Kock available at
`http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#fri`

After dinner, he spoke about $n$-stacks and $n$-gerbes:

15) Bertrand Toen, $n$-Stacks and $n$-gerbes: algebraic geometry. Notes by
Joachim Kock available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#fri`

Everyone slept all weekend long. Then on Monday of the second week, the
homotopy theorist Zbigniew Fiedorowicz spoke about his work on a kind of
n-fold monoidal category that has an $n$-fold loop space as its nerve. He
has some good papers on the web about this, too:

16) Zbigniew Fiedorowicz, $n$-Fold categories. Notes available at
`http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#mon2`

categories, available at

Z. Fiedorowicz, Constructions of E_n operads, available at
[math.AT/9808089](http://www.arXiv.org/abs/math.AT/9808089).

Stefan Forcey continued this theme by discussing enrichment over $n$-fold
monoidal categories. He also has a number of papers about this on the
arXiv, of which I'll just mention one:

17) Stefan Forcey, Higher enrichment: $n$-fold operads and enriched
$n$-categories, delooping and weakening. Notes available at

Also available as
[math.CT/0403152](http://www.arXiv.org/abs/math.CT/0403152).

After dinner we discussed how to relate different definitions of weak
$n$-category.

On Tuesday of the second week, the logician Michael Makkai presented his
astounding project of redoing logic in a way that completely eliminates
the concept of "equality". This *forces* you to do all of mathematics
using weak \infty-categories. I thought this stuff was great, in part because
I finally understood it, and in part because it leads naturally to the
"opetopic" definition of $n$-categories that James Dolan and I
introduced. The idea of eliminating equality was very much on our mind
in inventing this definition, but we didn't create a system of logic
that systematizes this idea.

There are no notes for Makkai's talk online, but you can get a lot of
good stuff from his website, including:

18) Michael Makkai, On comparing definitions of weak $n$-category,
available at `http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/`

and this more technical paper which works out the details of his vision:

19) Michael Makkai, The multitopic ω-category of all multitopic
ω-categories, available at `http://www.math.mcgill.ca/makkai/`

After Makkai's talk, Mark Weber spoke on $n$-categorical generalizations
of the concept of "monad", which is a nice way of describing
mathematical gadgets. There are no notes for this talk, but his work on
higher operads is at least morally related:

20) Mark Weber, Operads within monoidal pseudo algebras, available as
[math.CT/0410230](http://www.arXiv.org/abs/math.CT/0410230).

Again, after dinner we talked about how to relate different definitions
of weak $n$-category.

On Wednesday of the second week, Michael Batanin spoke about his recent
work relating $n$-categories to $n$-fold loop spaces. Again no notes, but
you can read these papers:

21) Michael Batanin, The Eckmann-Hilton argument, higher operads and
E_n-spaces, available at
`http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~mbatanin/papers.html`

Michael Batanin, The combinatorics of iterated loop spaces, available at
`http://www.ics.mq.edu.au/~mbatanin/papers.html`

Then Joachim Kock laid the ground for a discussion of $n$-categories and
topological quantum field theories, or "TQFTs", by explaining the
definition of a TQFT and the classification of 2d TQFTs:

22) Joachim Kock, Topological quantum field theory primer. Notes
available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#wed2`

In the evening, Marco Mackaay and I said more about the relation between
TQFTs and $n$-categories:

23) Marco Mackaay, Topological quantum field theories. Notes available
at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#wed2`

24) John Baez, Space and state, spacetime and process. Notes available
at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#wed2`

On Thursday, Ross Street started the day in a pleasantly different way -
he gave a historical account of work on categories and $n$-categories in
Australia! Australia is home to much of the best work on these subjects,
so if you can understand his history you'll wind up understanding these
subjects pretty well:

25) Ross Street, An Australian conspectus of higher category theory.
Notes available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#thur2`

As a younger exponent of the Australian tradition, it was then nicely
appropriate for Steve Lack to speak about ways of building a model
category of 2-categories:

26) Steve Lack, Higher model categories. Notes available at
`http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#thur2`

In the afternoon we had a blast of computer science. First John Power
gave a hilarious talk phrased in terms of how one should convince
computer theorists to embrace categories, then 2-categories, and then
maybe higher categories:

27) John Power, Why tricategories? Notes available at
`http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#thur2`

I spoke about Power's paper with this title back in
["Week 53"](#week53); now you can get it online!

Then Philippe Gaucher, Lisbeth Fajstrup and Eric Goubault spoke about
higher-dimensional automata and directed homotopy theory:

28) Philippe Gaucher, Towards a homotopy theory of higher dimensional
automata. Notes available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#thur2`

Lisbeth Fajstrup, More on directed topology and concurrency, Notes
available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#thur2`

Eric Goubault, Directed homotopy theory and higher-dimensional automata,
Notes available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#thur2`

On Friday, Martin Hyland and Tony Elmendorf gave a double-header talk on
higher-dimensional linear algebra and how some concepts in this subject
can be simplified using symmetric multicategories. There are, alas, no
notes for this talk. You just had to be there.

Finally, my student Alissa Crans gave a talk on higher-dimensional
linear algebra, with an emphasis on categorified Lie algebras:

29) Alissa Crans, Higher linear algebra. Notes available at Notes
available at `http://www.ima.umn.edu/categories/#fri2`

Hers was the last talk in the workshop! I would like to say more about
it, but I'm exhausted... and her talk fits naturally into a discussion
of "higher gauge theory", which deserves a Week of its own.

By the way, you can see pictures of this workshop here:

30) John Baez, IMA, `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/IMA/`

If you want to see what these crazy $n$-category people look like, you can
see most of them here.

Hmm. If you wanted me to actually *explain* something this week, I'm
afraid you'll be rather disappointed - so far everything has just been
pointers to other material.

Luckily, while I was at this workshop I wrote a little explanation of
some material on Picard groups and Brauer groups. There's a Spanish
school of higher-dimensional algebra, centered in Granada, and this
spring Aurora del Rio Cabeza came from Granada to visit UCR. She and
James Dolan spent a lot of time talking about categorical groups (also
known as "2-groups") and cohomology theory. I was, alas, too busy to
keep up with their conversations, but I learned a little from listening
in... and here's my writeup!

Higher categories show up quite naturally in the study of commutative
rings and associative algebras over commutative rings. I'd heard of
things called "Brauer groups" and "Picard groups" of rings, and
something called "Morita equivalence", but I only understood how these
fit together when I learned they were part of a marvelous thing: a weak
3-groupoid!

Here's how it goes. You don't need to know much about higher
categories for this to make some sense... at least, I hope not.

Starting with a commutative ring R, we can form a weak 2-category Alg(R)
where:

-   an object A is an associative algebra over R,
-   a 1-morphism M\colon  A \to  B is an (A,B)-bimodule,
-   a 2-morphism f\colon  M \to  N is a homomorphism between (A,B)-bimodules.

This has all the structure you need to get a 2-category. In particular,
we can "compose" an (A,B)-bimodule and a (B,C)-bimodule by tensoring
them over B, getting an (A,C) bimodule. But since tensor products are
only associative up to isomorphism, we only get a *weak* 2-category, not
a strict one.

This weak 2-category has a tensor product, since we can tensor two
associative algebras over R and get another one. All the stuff listed
above gets along with this process! When an $n$-category has a
well-behaved tensor product we call it "monoidal", so Alg(R) is a weak
monoidal 2-category. But using a standard trick we can reinterpret this
as a weak 3-category with one object, as follows:

-   there's only one object, R
-   a 1-morphism A\colon  R \to  R is an associative algebra over R
-   a 2-morphism M\colon  A \to  B is an (A,B)-bimodule
-   a 3-morphism f\colon  M \to  N is a homomorphism between (A,B)-bimodules.

Note how all the morphisms have shifted up a notch. What used to be
called objects, the associative algebras over R, are now called
1-morphisms. We "compose" them by tensoring them over R.

Next, recall a bit of $n$-category theory from ["Week 35"](#week35).
In an $n$-category we define a j-morphism to be an "equivalence" iff
it's invertible... up to equivalence! This definition may sound
circular, but really just recursive. To start it off we just need to add
that an $n$-morphism is an equivalence iff it's invertible.

What does equivalence amount to in the 3-category Alg(R)? It's easiest
to figure this out from the top down:

-   A 3-morphism f\colon  M \to  N is an equivalence iff it's invertible, so
    it's an isomorphism between (A,B)-bimodules.

-   A 2-morphism M\colon  A \to  B is an equivalence iff it's invertible up to
    isomorphism, meaning there exists N\colon  B \to  A such that:

    -   M \otimes~B~ N is isomorphic to A as an (A,A)-bimodule,
    -   N \otimes~A~ M is isomorphic to B as a (B,B)-bimodule.

    In this situation people say M is a "Morita equivalence" from A
    to B.

-   A 1-morphism A\colon  R \to  R is an equivalence iff it's invertible up to
    Morita equivalence, meaning there exists a 1-morphism B\colon  x \to  x such
    that:

    -   A \otimes~R~ B is Morita equivalent to R as an associative algebra
        over R,
    -   B \otimes~R~ A is Morita equivalent to R as an associative algebra
        over R.

    In this situation people say A is an "Azumaya algebra".

Here's a nice example of how Morita equivalence works. Over any
commutative ring R there's an algebra R\[n\] consisting of n x n
matrices with entries in R. R\[n\] isn't usually isomorphic to R\[m\],
but they're always Morita equivalent! To see this, suppose

M\colon  R\[n\] \to  R\[m\] is the space of n x m matrices with entries in R,

N\colon  R\[m\] \to  R\[n\] is the space of m x n matrices with entries in R.

These become bimodules in an obvious way via matrix multiplication, and
a little calculation shows that they're inverses up to isomorphism!

So, all the algebras R\[n\] are Morita equivalent. In particular this
means that they're all Morita equivalent to R, so they are Azumaya
algebras of a rather trivial sort.

If we take R to be the real numbers there is also a more interesting
Azumaya algebra over R, namely the quaternions H. This follows from the
fact that

H \otimes~R~ H = R\[4\]

This says H \otimes~R~ H is Morita equivalent to R as an associative algebra
over R, which implies (by the definition above) that H is an Azumaya
algebra.

Morita equivalence is really important in the theory of C*-algebras,
Clifford algebras, and things like that. Someday I want to explain how
it's connected to Bott periodicity! Oh, there's so much I want to
explain....

But right now I want to take our 3-category Alg(R), massage it a bit,
and turn it into a topological space! Then I'll look at the homotopy
groups of this space and see what they have to say about our ring R.

To do this, we need a bit more $n$-category theory. A weak $n$-category
where all the 1-morphisms, 2-morphisms and so on are equivalences is
called a "n-groupoid". For example, given any weak $n$-category, we can
form a weak $n$-groupoid called its "core" by throwing out all the
morphisms that aren't equivalences.

So, let's take the core of Alg(R) and get a weak 3-groupoid. Here's
what it's like:

-   There's one object, R.
-   The 1-morphisms A\colon  x \to  x are Azumaya algebras over R.
-   The 2-morphisms M\colon  A \to  B are Morita equivalences.
-   The 3-morphisms f\colon  M \to  N are bimodule isomorphisms.

Since as a groupoid with one object is a group, this weak 3-groupoid
with one object deserves to be called a "3-group".

Next, given a weak $n$-groupoid with one object, it's very nice to
compute its "homotopy groups". These are easy to define in general,
but I'll just do it for the core of Alg(R) and let you guess the
general pattern. First, notice that:

-   The identity 1-morphism 1~R~\colon  R \to  R is just R, regarded as an
    associative algebra over itself in the obvious way.
-   The identity 2-morphism 1_1R~~\colon  1~R~ \to  1~R~ is just R, regarded as
    an (R,R)-bimodule in the obvious way.
-   The identity 3-morphism 1_11~R~~~\colon  1_1R~~ \to  1_1R~~ is just the
    identity function on R, regarded as an isomorphism of
    (R,R)-bimodules.

At this point we let out a cackle of $n$-categorical glee. Then, we define
the homotopy groups of the core of Alg(R) as follows:

-   The 1st homotopy group consists of equivalence classes of
    1-morphisms from R to itself.
-   The 2nd homotopy group consists of equivalence classes of
    2-morphisms from 1~R~ to itself
-   The 3rd homotopy group consists of equivalence classes of
    3-morphisms from 1_1R~~ to itself.

Here we say two morphisms in an $n$-category are "equivalent" if there
is an equivalence from one to the other (or if they're equal, in the
case of $n$-morphisms).

I hope the pattern in this definition of homotopy groups is obvious. In
fact, $n$-groupoids are secretly "the same" - in a subtle sense I'd
rather not explain - as spaces whose homotopy groups vanish above
dimension n. Using this, the homotopy groups as defined above turn out
to be same as the homotopy groups of a certain space associated with the
ring R! So, we're doing something very funny: we're using algebraic
topology to study algebra.

But, we don't need to know this to figure out what these homotopy
groups are like. Unraveling the definitions a bit, one sees they amount
to this:

-   The 1st homotopy group consists of Morita equivalence classes of
    Azumaya algebras over R. This is also called the BRAUER GROUP of R.
-   The 2nd homotopy group consists of isomorphism classes of Morita
    equivalences from R to R. This is also called the PICARD GROUP of R.
-   The 3rd homotopy group consists of invertible elements of R. This is
    also called the UNIT GROUP of R.

People had been quite happily studying these groups for a long time
without knowing they were the homotopy groups of the core of a weak
3-category associated to the commutative ring R! But, the relationships
between these groups are easier to explain if you use the $n$-categorical
picture. It's a great example of how $n$-categories unify mathematics.

For example, everything we've done is functorial. So, if you have a
homomorphism between commutative rings, say

f\colon  R \to  S

then you get a weak 3-functor

Alg(f)\colon  Alg(R) \to  Alg(S)

This gives a weak 3-functor from the core of Alg(R) to the core of
Alg(S), and thus a map between spaces... which in turn gives a long
exact sequence of homotopy groups! So, we get interesting maps going
from the unit, Picard and groups of R to those of S - and these fit into
an interesting long exact sequence.

For more, try the following papers. The first paper is actually about a
generalization of Azumaya algebras called "Azumaya categories", but it
starts with a nice quick review of Azumaya algebras and Brauer groups:

31) Francis Borceux and Enrico Vitale, Azumaya categories, available at
`http://www.math.ucl.ac.be/AGEL/Azumaya_categories.pdf`

Category theorists will enjoy the generalization: since algebras are
just one-object categories enriched over Vect, the concept of Azumaya
algebra really *wants* to generalize to that of an Azumaya category.
I'm sure most of the Brauer-Picard-Morita stuff generalizes too, but I
haven't checked that out yet.

This second paper makes the connection between Picard and Brauer groups
explicit using categorical groups:

32) Enrico Vitale, A Picard-Brauer exact sequence of categorical
groups, Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 175 (2002) 383-408. Also

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Addendum:** It turns out that the Picard-Brauer 3-group has a long and
illustrious history. Ross Street explained this to me; I've taken the
liberty of numbering the references in his email.
