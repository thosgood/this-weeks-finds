# DATE {#week227}

Today I want to say a bit about physics, and then a bit about about
logic, since that's what I was studying for the last month in
Marseille. But first, the astronomy pictures of the week:

On August 4, 2004, the Mars rover called Opportunity took these pictures
of dunes as it entered Endurance Crater. The red one is what we'd
actually see; the blue one is a false-color image designed to bring out
certain details.

Both images show show tendrils of sand less than 1 meter high stretching
from the big dunes toward the rover, and some rocks in the foreground.
The false-color image emphasizes accumulations of millimeter-sized
spheres called "blueberries" on the flat parts of the dunes. Here's
what they look like close up:

2) Mineral in Mars "berries" adds to water story, NASA/JPL, available
at `http://marsrover.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040318a.html`

Thanks to a Mössbauer spectroscope aboard the rover, which studies rocks
by firing \gamma rays at them, we know these blueberries contain a lot of
hematite.

Hematite is made of ferric oxide, Fe_2O_3, otherwise known as
"rust". It's usually formed in the presence of water. For this and
other reasons, it's believed that the blueberries in Endurance Crater
were formed when Mars was wetter than today. An interesting puzzle is
whether they were formed by groundwater leaching ferric oxide from
rocks, or deposited in standing water - for example, a lake.

It's amazing how much we can learn from unmanned space probes. And
it's amazing to me how some people want to spend billions on manned
missions. To read more about what SF writers Larry Niven, Joe Haldeman,
Greg Bear and other folks including me think about the merits of manned
versus unmanned space missions, try this:

But enough space stuff... now for some physics!

A strange thing happened around the 1980s. Before that, theorists had
been making rapid and revolutionary progress in understanding the
fundamental laws of physics for almost a century. They kept predicting
shocking new effects that were soon found in actual experiments: radio
waves, nuclear chain reactions, black holes, lasers, antimatter,
neutrinos, quarks,... up to and including the W and Z bosons. The power
of human thought never seemed greater.

Since the 1980s, most of the new discoveries in fundamental physics have
come from unexpected observations in astronomy. These observations were
mostly *not* predicted by theorists. The key examples are: dark matter,
dark energy, and neutrino oscillations. The only serious counterexamples
that come to mind are the top quark, discovered in 1995, and Alan
Guth's inflationary cosmology, dreamt up around 1979 and *partially*
confirmed by recent data - though the jury is still out.

Theorists are publishing more than ever, but most of their theories are
either not yet testable (string theory, loop quantum gravity) or seem to
have been disproved by experiment (grand unified theory predictions of
proton decay).

It's interesting to meditate on why this change has happened, what it
means, and what will happen next. I spoke about this in Marseille
shortly before coming home to Riverside. You can see my slides here:

4) John Baez, Fundamental physics: where we stand today, lecture at at
the Faculty of Sciences, Luminy, February 27th, 2006, available at
`http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/where_we_stand/`

This talk was for nonphysicists, so it's not very technical. The first
part is a gentle introduction to the laws of physics as we know them.

For more info on dark matter and dark energy, try this:

5) Varun Sahri, Dark matter and dark energy, available as
[`astro-ph/0403324`](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403324).

If you read this, you'll learn about the "cuspy core problem" -
existing cold dark matter models produce galaxies with a sharp spikes of
high density near their cores, sharper than observed. You'll learn
about "quintessence", a kind of hypothetical field that some people
use to model dark energy, thus "explaining" the accelerating expansion
of the universe. You'll learn about the "Chaplygin gas", a
hypothetical substance whose properties interpolate between those of
cold dark matter and dark energy. And, you'll learn about "phantom
energy" models of dark energy, which fit the accelerating expansion of
the universe quite nicely now but predict a "Big Rip", in which the
expansion rate eventually becomes *infinite*.

In short, you'll see how people are flailing around trying to
understand dark matter and dark energy.

For more on neutrino oscillations, try this:

available as [hep-ex/0412032](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0412032).

I had a great time in Marseille. The area around there is great for
mathematicians. Algebraists can visit the beautiful nearby city of Aix -
pronounced "x". Logicians will enjoy the dry, dusty island of If -
pronounced "eef", just like a French logician would say it. And
everyone will enjoy the medieval hill town of Les Baux, which looks like
something out of Escher. Here's a
[picture](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/france_2006) of it:

![](LesBaux_2006_002.small2.jpg){width="600" height="500"}

Actually the Chateau D'If, on the island of the same name, is where
Edmond Dantes was imprisoned in Alexander Dumas' novel "The Count of
Monte Cristo". It's in this formidable fortress that the wise old Abbe
Faria tells Dantes the location of the treasure that later made him
rich.

I guess everyone except me read this story as a kid - I'm just reading
it now. But how many of you remember that Faria spent his time in prison
studying the works of Aristotle? There's a great scene where Dantes
asks Faria where he learned so much about logic, and Faria replies: "If
- and only If!"

That Dumas guy sure was a joker.

Luckily I didn't need to be locked up on a deserted island to learn
some logic in Marseille. There were lots of great talks on this topic at
the conference I attended:

7) Geometry of Computation 2006 (Geocal06),
`http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/geocal06/`

For example, Yves Lafont gave a category-theoretic approach to Boolean
logic gates which explains their relation to Feynman diagrams:

8) Yves Lafont, Towards an algebraic theory of Boolean circuits,
Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 184 (2003), 257-310. Also available
at `http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~lafont/publications.html`

and together with Yves Guiraud, Francois Metayer and Albert Burroni, he
gave a detailed introduction to the homology of $n$-categories and its
application to rewrite rules. The idea is to study any sort of algebraic
gadget (like a group) by creating an $n$-category where the objects are
"expressions" for elements in the gadget, the morphisms are "ways of
rewriting expressions" by applying the rules at hand, the 2-morphisms
are "ways of passing from one way of rewriting expressions to another"
by applying certain "meta-rules", and so on. Then one can use ideas
from algebraic topology to study this $n$-category and prove stuff about
the original gadget!

To understand how this actually works, it's best to start with Craig
Squier's work on the word problem for monoids. I explained this pretty
carefully back in ["Week 70"](#week70) when I first heard Lafont
lecture on this topic - it made a big impression on me! You can read
more here:

Applications of Categories 11 (2003), 148-184. Available online at
`http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/7/11-07abs.html`

I was also lucky to get some personal tutoring from folks including
Laurent Regnier, Peter Selinger and especially Phil Scott. Ever since
["Week 40"](#week40), I've been trying to understand something
called "linear logic", which was invented by Jean-Yves Girard, who
teaches in Marseille. Thanks to all this tutoring, I think I finally get
it!

To get a taste of what Phil Scott told me, you should read this:

14) Philip J. Scott, Some aspects of categories in computer science,
Handbook of Algebra, Vol. 2, ed. M. Hazewinkel, Elsevier, New York,
2000. Available as `http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~phil/papers/`

Right now, I'm only up to explaining a microscopic portion of this
stuff. But since the typical reader of This Week's Finds may know more
about physics than logic, maybe that's good. In fact, I'll use this as
an excuse to simplify everything tremendously, leaving out all sorts of
details that a real logician would want.

Logic can be divided into two parts: SYNTAX and SEMANTICS. Roughly
speaking, syntax concerns the symbols you scribble on the page, while
semantics concerns what these symbols mean.

A bit more precisely, imagine some kind of logical system where you
write down some theory - like the axioms for a group, say - and use it
to prove theorems.

In the realm of syntax, we focus on the form our theory is allowed to
have, and how we can deduce new sentences from old ones. So, one of the
key concepts is that of a PROOF. The details will vary depending on the
kind of logical system we're studying.

In the realm of semantics, we are interested in gadgets that actually
satisfy the axioms in our theory - for example, actual groups, if we're
thinking about the theory of groups. Such a gadget is called a MODEL of
the theory. Again, the details vary immensely.

In the realm of syntax, we say a list of axioms X "implies" a sentence
P if we can prove P from X using some deduction rules, and we write this
as

X |- P

In the realm of semantics, we say a list of axioms X "entails" a
sentence P if every model of X is also a model of P, and we write this
as

X |= P

Syntax and semantics are "dual" in a certain sense - a sense that can
be made very precise if one fixes a specific class of logical systems.
This duality is akin to the usual relation between vector spaces and
their duals, or more generally groups and their categories of
representations. The idea is that given a theory T you can figure out
its models, which form a category Mod(T) - and conversely, given the
category of models Mod(T), perhaps with a little extra information, you
can reconstruct T.

A little extra information? Well, in some cases a model of T will be a
*set* with some extra structure - for example, if T is the theory of
groups, a model of T will be a group, which is a set equipped with some
operations. So, in these cases there's a functor

U\colon  Mod(T) \to  \mathsf{Set}

assigning each model its underlying set. And, you can easily reconstruct
T from Mod(T) *together* with this functor.

This idea was worked out by Lawvere for a class of logical systems
called algebraic theories, which I discussed in
["Week 200"](#week200). But, the same idea goes by the name of
"Tannaka-Krein duality" in a different context: a Hopf algebra H has a
category of comodules Rep(H), which comes equipped with a functor

U\colon  Rep(H) \to  Vect

assigning each comodule its underlying vector space. And, you can
reconstruct H from Rep(H) together with this functor. The proof is even
very similar to Lawvere's proof for algebraic theories!

I gave a bunch of talks in Marseille about algebraic theories, some
related logical systems called PROPs and PROs, and their relation to
quantum theory, especially Feynman diagrams:

14) John Baez, Universal algebra and diagrammatic reasoning, available
as `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/universal/`

I came mighty close to explaining how to compute the cohomology of an
algebraic theory... and you can read more about that here:

15) Mauka Jibladze and Teimuraz Pirashvili, Cohomology of algebraic
theories, J. Algebra 137 (1991) 253-296.

Mauka Jibladze and Teimuraz Pirashvili, Quillen cohomology and
Baues-Wirsching cohomology of algebraic theories, Max-Planck-Institut
für Mathematik, preprint series 86 (2005).

But alas, I didn't get around to talking about the duality between
syntax and semantics. For that Lawvere's original thesis is a good
place to go:

16) F. William Lawvere, Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories,
Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, 1963. Also available at
`http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5abs.html`

Anyway, the stuff Phil Scott told me about was mainly over on the syntax
side. Here categories show up in another way. Oversimplifying as usual,
the idea is to create a category where an object P is a *sentence* - or
maybe a list of sentences - and a morphism

f\colon  P \to  Q

is a *proof* of Q from P - or maybe an equivalence class of proofs.

We can compose proofs in a more or less obvious way, so with any luck
this gives a category! And, different kinds of logical system give us
different kinds of categories.

Quite famously, the multiplicative fragment of intuitionistic logic
gives cartesian closed categories. (The "multiplicative fragment" is
the portion that deals with "and" and "implies" but leaves out
"or" and "not". I'm calling it this because "and" acts like
multiplication, while "or" acts like addition.) Similarly, the
multiplicative fragment of linear logic gives *-autonomous categories.
Full-fledged intuitionistic logic gives cartesian closed categories with
finite coproducts, and full-fledged linear logic gives us even fancier
kinds of categories! If you want to learn about these examples, read the
handbook article by Phil Scott mentioned above.

One thing that intrigues me is the equivalence relation we need to get a
category whose morphisms are equivalence classes of proofs. In
Gentzen's "natural deduction" approach to logic, there are various
deduction rules. Here's one:

    P |- Q    P |- Q'
    ------------------
      P |- Q & Q'

This says that if P implies Q and it also implies Q', then it implies Q
& Q'.

Here's another:

    P |- Q \Rightarrow R
    ------------
    P and Q |- R

And here's a very important one, called the "cut rule":

    P |- Q    Q |- R
    -----------------
         P |- R

If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R!

There are a bunch more... and to get the game rolling we need to start
with this:

    P |- P

In this setup, a proof f\colon  P \to  Q looks vaguely like this:

        f-crud
        f-crud
        f-crud
        f-crud
        f-crud
        f-crud
     -------------
        P |- Q 

The stuff I'm calling "f-crud" is a bunch of steps which use the
deduction rules to get to P |- Q.

Suppose we also we also have a proof

g\colon  Q \to  R

There's a way to stick f and g together to get a proof

fg\colon  P \to  R

This proof consists of setting the proofs f and g side by side and then
using the cut rule to finish the job. So, fg looks like this:

         f-crud     g-crud
         f-crud     g-crud
         f-crud     g-crud
         f-crud     g-crud
        --------   --------
         P |- Q     Q |- R
       ---------------------
               P |- R 

Now let's see if composition is associative. Suppose we also have a
proof

h\colon  R \to  S

We can form proofs

(fg)h\colon  P \to  S

and

f(gh)\colon  P \to  S

Are they equal? No! The first one looks like this:


         f-crud     g-crud
         f-crud     g-crud
         f-crud     g-crud       h-crud
         f-crud     g-crud       h-crud
        --------   --------      h-crud
         P |- Q     Q |- R       h-crud
       ---------------------   ----------- 
               P |- R            R |- S 
             ----------------------------
                        P |- S

while the second one looks like this:


                    g-crud       h-crud
                    g-crud       h-crud
        f-crud      g-crud       h-crud
        f-crud      g-crud       h-crud
        f-crud     --------     --------      
        f-crud      Q |- R       R |- S      
       ---------   --------------------- 
        P |- Q            Q |- S 
       ----------------------------
                P |- S

So, they're not quite equal! This is one reason we need an equivalence
relation on proofs to get a category. Both proofs resemble trees, but
the first looks more like this:

    \  /  /
     \/  /
      \ /
       |

while the second looks more like this:

    \  \  /
     \  \/
      \ /
       |

So, we need an equivalence relation that identifies these proofs if we
want composition to be associative!

This sort of idea, including this "tree" business, is very familiar
from homotopy theory, where we need a similar equivalence relation if we
want composition of paths to be associative. But in homotopy theory,
people have learned that it's often better NOT to impose an equivalence
relation on paths! Instead, it's better to form a *weak 2-category* of
paths, where there's a 2-morphism going from this sort of composite:

    \  /  /
     \/  /
      \ /
       |

to this one:

    \  \  /
     \  \/
      \ /
       |

This is called the "associator". In our logic context, we can think of
the associator as a way to transform one proof into another.

The associator should satisfy an equation called the "pentagon
identity", which I explained back in ["Week 144"](#week144).
However, it will only do this if we let 2-morphisms be *equivalence
classes* of proof transformations.

So, there's a kind of infinite regress here. To deal with this, it
would be best to work with a "weak ω-category" with

sentences (or sequences of sentences) as objects,\
proofs as morphisms,\
proof transformations as 2-morphisms,\
transformations of proof transformations as 3-morphisms,...\

and so on. With this, we would never need any equivalence relations: we
keep track of all transformations explicitly. This is almost beyond what
mathematicians are capable of at present, but it's clearly a good thing
to strive toward.

So far, it seems Seely has gone the furthest in this direction. In his
thesis, way back in 1977, he studied what one might call "weak
cartesian closed 2-categories" arising from proof theory. You can read
an account of this work here:

Conf. on Applications of Sheaves, Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics

IEEE, pp. 65-71. Also available at
`http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/WkAdj/LICS.pdf`

Can we go all the way and cook up some sort of ω-category of proofs?
Interestingly, while the logicians at Geocal06 were talking about
$n$-categories and the geometry of proofs, the mathematician Vladimir
Voevodsky was giving some talks at Stanford about something that sounds
pretty similar:

17) Vladimir Voevodsky, lectures on homotopy λ calculus, notice at
`http://math.stanford.edu/distinguished_voevodsky.htm`

Voevodsky has thought hard about $n$-categories, and he won the Fields
medal for his applications of homotopy theory to algebraic geometry.

The typed λ calculus is another way of thinking about intuitionistic
logic - or in other words, cartesian closed categories of proofs. The
"homotopy λ calculus" should thus be something similar, but where we
keep track of transformations between proofs, transformations between
transformations between proofs... and so on ad infinitum.

But that's just my guess! Is this what Voevodsky is talking about??? I
haven't managed to get anyone to tell me. Maybe I'll email him and
ask.

There were a lot of other cool talks at Geocal06, like Girard's talk on
applications of von Neumann algebras (especially the hyperfinite type
II_1 factor!) in logic, and Peter Selinger's talk on the category of
completely positive maps, diagrammatic methods for dealing with these
maps, and their applications to quantum logic:

positive maps, available at

But, I want to finish writing this and go out and have some waffles for
my Sunday brunch. So, I'll stop here!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Addendum:** I thank Aaron Lauda, Paul Levy and Peter McBurney for
corrections. Jeffrey Winkler points out that "hematite" got its name
from the Greek word for "blood" because the ancient Greeks thought
these rocks marked the locations of battles where the blood of warriors
had soaked into the rocks. This is appropriate, since Mars is the god of
war!

An anonymous correspondent had this to say about the "homotopy λ
calculus":
