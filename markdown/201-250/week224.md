# December 14, 2005 {#week224}

This week I want to mention a couple of papers lying on the interface of
physics, topology, and higher-dimensional algebra. But first, some
astronomy pictures... and a bit about the mathematical physicist
Hamilton!

I like this photo of a jet emanating from the black hole in the center
of galaxy M87:

M87 is a giant elliptical galaxy. It's long been known as a powerful
radio source, and now we know why: there's a supermassive black hole in
the center, about 3 billion times the mass of our Sun. As matter spirals
into this huge black hole, it forms an "accretion disk", and some gets
so hot that it shoots out in a jet, as envisioned here:

Accretion disks and jets are common at many different scales in our
universe. They're just nature's way of letting a bunch of matter fall
in under its own gravitation while losing angular momentum and energy.
We see them when dust clouds collapse to form stars, we see them when
black holes sucks in mass from companion stars, and they're probably
also responsible for slow $\gamma$ ray bursts as huge stars collapse when they
run out of fuel --- see ["Week 204"](#week204) for that story.

But, among the biggest accretion disks and jets are those surrounding
supermassive black holes in the middle of galaxies. These are probably
responsible for all the "active galactic nuclei" or "quasars" that
we see. In the case of M87 the jet is enormous: 5000 light years long!
To get a sense of the scale, look at the small white specks away from
the jet in the next picture. These are globular clusters: clusters
containing between ten thousand and a million stars.

The jet in M87 is so hot that it emits not just radio waves and visible
light, but even X-rays, as seen by the Chandra X-ray telescope:
$$\href{http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2001/0134/}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/m87_xray_radio_optical.jpg}}$$

4) "M87: Chandra sheds light on the knotty problem of the M87 jet", `http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2001/0134/`

It seems the jet consists mainly of electrons moving at relativistic
speeds, focused by the magnetic field of the accretion disk. They come
in blobs called "knots". People can actually see these blobs moving
out, getting brighter and dimmer.

In fact, many galaxies have super-massive black holes at their centers
with jets like this one. The special thing about M87 is that it's
fairly nearby, hence easy to see. M87 is the biggest galaxy in the Virgo
Cluster. This is the closest galaxy cluster to us, about 50 million
light years away. That sounds pretty far, but it's only 1000 times the
radius of the Milky Way. If the Milky Way were a pebble, M87 would be
only a stone's throw away. So, even amateur astronomers --- really good
ones, at least --- can take photos of M87 that show the jet. But here's a
high-quality picture produced by Robert Lupton using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey --- you can see the jet in light blue:

Backing off a bit further, let's take a look at the Virgo Cluster. It
contains over a thousand galaxies, but we can tell it's fairly new as
clusters go, since it consists of a bunch of "subclusters" that
haven't merged yet. Our galaxy, and indeed the whole Local Group to
which it belongs, is being pulled towards the Virgo Cluster and will
eventually join it. Here's a nice closeup of part of the Virgo Cluster:

6) Chris Mihos, Paul Harding, John Feldmeier and Heather Morrison, "Deep imaging of the Virgo Cluster", `http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/Schmidt/Virgo/`

Finally, just for fun, something unrelated --- and more mysterious. It's
called "Hoag's object":
$$\href{http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/21/}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/hoag.jpg}}$$

7) The Hubble Heritage Project, "Hoag's Object", `http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/21/`

It's a ring-shaped galaxy full of hot young blue stars surrounding a
ball of yellower stars. Nobody knows how it formed: perhaps by a
collision of two galaxies? Such collisions are fairly common, but they
don't typically create this sort of structure.

The weirdest part is that inside the ring, in the upper right, you can
see *another* ring galaxy in the distance! Maybe an advanced
civilization over there enjoys this form of art? Probably not, but if it
turns out to be true, you heard it here first.

Anyway... back here on Earth, in the summer of 2004, I visited Dublin
for a conference on general relativity called GR17. As recounted in
["Week 207"](#week207), this was where Hawking admitted defeat in
his famous bet with John Preskill about information loss due to black
hole evaporation. In August of this year, Hawking finally came out with
a short paper on the subject:

8) Stephen W. Hawking, "Information loss in black holes", available as [`hep-th/0507171`](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0507171).

I spent a lot of time talking to physicists, but I also wandered around
Dublin a bit. Besides listening to some great music at a pub called
Cobblestones --- Kevin Rowsome plays a mean uilleann pipe! --- and tracking
down some sites mentioned in James Joyce's novel "Ulysses", I went
with Tevian Dray on a pilgrimage to Brougham Bridge.

Tevian Dray is an expert on the octonions, and Brougham Bridge is where
Hamilton carved his famous formula defining the quaternions! Now there
is a plaque commemorating this event, which reads:

> Here as he walked by\
> on the 16th of October 1843\
> Sir William Rowan Hamilton\
> in a flash of genius discovered\
> the fundamental formula for\
> quaternion multiplication\
> $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$\
> & cut it on a stone of this bridge

It does't mention that Hamilton had been racking his brain for the
entire month of October trying to solve this problem: "flashes of
genius" favor the prepared mind. But it's a nice story and a nice
place. My friend Tevian Dray took some photos, which you can see here:

9) John Baez, "Dublin", `http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dublin/`

It was a bit of a challenge finding Brougham Bridge, since nobody at the
main bus station gave us correct information about which bus went there
--- except the bus driver who finally took us there. So, to ease your way
in case you want to make your own pilgrimage, the above page includes
directions. And now, thanks to Dirk Schlimm, it also includes a link to
a map showing the bridge!

Speaking of Hamilton, Theron Stanford recently sent me an answer to one
of life's persistent questions: why is momentum denoted by the letter
p?

Since momentum and position play fundamental roles in Hamiltonian
mechanics, and they're denoted by $p$ and $q$, one wonders: could this
notation be related to Hamilton's alcoholism in later life? After all,
some claim the saying *mind your p's and q's* began as a friendly
Irish warning not to imbibe too many pints and quarts! So, maybe he used
these letters in his work on physics as a secret plea for help.

Umm... probably not. Just kidding. But in the absence of hard facts,
speculation runs rampant. So, I'm glad Stanford provided some of the
former, to squelch the latter.

He sent me this email:

So, now the question is why Hamilton chose the letter $\varpi$ for momentum. This variant of $\pi$ was fairly common in the mathematical
literature of the day, so there may be no special explanation. For some
further detective work, see:

10) "Hamilton: two mysteries solved", `http://groups.google.com/group/sci.physics/browse_thread/thread/d1b7b4a998682bbb/3a868ae8218a4bca#3a868ae8218a4bca`

Also see equation 12 in this paper for one of the first uses of
"$\varpi$" to mean momentum:

11) William Rowan Hamilton, "Second essay on a general method in dynamics", ed. David R. Wilkins, available at `http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Dynamics/SecEssay.pdf`

He doesn't say why he chose this letter --- it may have been completely
random!

Before I turn to higher-dimensional algebra, maybe this is a good time
to mention a paper related to the octonions:

12) Jakob Palmkvist, "A realization of the Lie algebra associated to a Kantor triple system", available as [`math.RA/0504544`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0504544).

In ["Week 193"](#week193) I mentioned how $3$-graded Lie algebras
come from "Jordan triple systems", and vaguely hinted that $5$-graded
Lie algebras come from "Kantor triple systems". I explained how the
exceptional Lie algebra $\mathrm{E}_8$ gets to be $5$-graded, but I didn't really say
anything about Kantor triple systems because my understanding of them
was so poor. This paper by Palmkvist explains them very clearly! And
even better, he shows how the "magic square" Lie algebras $\mathrm{F}_4$, $\mathrm{E}_6$, $\mathrm{E}_7$,
and $\mathrm{E}_8$ can be systematically obtained from the octonions, bioctonions,
quateroctonions and octooctonions by means of Kantor triple systems.

Now for some mathematical physics that touches on higher-dimensional
algebra. If you still don't get why topological field theory and
$n$-categories are so cool, read this thesis:

13) Bruce H. Bartlett, _Categorical aspects of topological quantum field theories_, M.Sc. Thesis, Utrecht University, 2005. Available as [`math.QA/0512103`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0512103).

It's a great explanation of the big picture! I can't wait to see what
Bartlett does for his Ph.D..

If you're a bit deeper into this stuff, you'll enjoy this:

14) Aaron Lauda and Hendryk Pfeiffer, "Open-closed strings: two-dimensional extended TQFTs and Frobenius algebras", available as [`math.AT/0510664`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.AT/0510664).

This paper gives a purely algebraic description of the topology of open
and closed strings, making precise and proving some famous results
stated without proof by Moore and Segal, which can be seen here:

15) Greg Moore, "Lectures on branes, K-theory and RR charges", _Clay Math Institute Lecture Notes_ (2002), available at `http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/clay1/clay1.html`

Lauda and Pfeiffer's paper makes heavy use of Frobenius algebras,
developing more deeply some of the themes I mentioned in
["Week 174"](#week174). In a related piece of work, Lauda has
figured out how to *categorify* the concept of a Frobenius algebra, and
has applied this to 3d topology:

16) Aaron Lauda, "Frobenius algebras and ambidextrous adjunctions", [_Theory and Applications of Categories_ **16** (2006) 84--122](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/16/4/16-04abs.html). Also available as [`math.CT/0502550`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CT/0502550).

    Aaron Lauda, "Frobenius algebras and planar open string topological field theories", available as [`math.QA/0508349`](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0508349).

The basic idea behind all this work is a "periodic table" of
categorified Frobenius algebras, which are related to topology in
different dimensions. For example, in ["Week 174"](#week174) I
explained how Frobenius algebras formalize the idea of paint drips on a
sheet of rubber. As you move your gaze down a sheet of rubber covered
with drips of paint, you'll notice that drips can merge:

                          \ \         / /  
                           \ \       / /
                            \ \     / /
                             \ \   / /
                              \ \_/ /      
                               \   /                                        
                                | |
                                | |
                                | |
                                | |
                                | |   

but also split:

                                | |
                                | |   
                                | |
                                | |
                                | |
                               / _ \                                            
                              / / \ \      
                             / /   \ \
                            / /     \ \
                           / /       \ \
                          / /         \ \ 

In addition, drips can start:

                                _
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |

but also end:

                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               | |
                               |_|

In a Frobenius algebra, these four pictures correspond to four
operations called "multiplication" (merging), "comultiplication"
(splitting), the "unit" (starting) and the "counit" (ending).
Moreover, these operations satisfy precisely the relations that you can
prove by warping the piece of rubber and seeing how the pictures change.
For example, there's the associative law:

                \ \    / /    / /      \ \    \ \    / /
                 \ \  / /    / /        \ \    \ \  / /
                  \ \/ /    / /          \ \    \ \/ /
                   \  /    / /            \ \    \  /
                    \ \   / /              \ \   / /
                     \ \_/ /                \ \_/ /
                      \   /                  \   /
                       | |                    | |
                       | |                    | |    
                       | |          =         | |
                       | |                    | |
                       | |                    | |
                       | |                    | |
                       | |                    | |
                       | |                    | |

The idea here is that if you draw the picture on the left-hand side on a
sheet of rubber, you can warp the rubber until it looks like the
right-hand side! There's also the "coassociative law", which is just
an upside-down version of the above picture. But the most interesting
laws are the "$I = N$" equation:

                   \ \     / /                | |        | |
                    \ \   / /                 | |        | |
                     \ \_/ /                  | |        | |
                      \   /                   |  \       | |
                       | |                    |   \      | |
                       | |                    | |\ \     | |   
                       | |                    | | \ \    | |
                       | |                    | |  \ \   | |
                       | |          =         | |   \ \  | |
                       | |                    | |    \ \ | |
                       | |                    | |     \ | |
                       | |                    | |      \   |
                      / _ \                   | |       \  |
                     / / \ \                  | |        | |
                    / /   \ \                 | |        | | 
                   / /     \ \                | |        | |

and its mirror-image version.

So, the concept of Frobenius algebra captures the topology of regions in
the plane! Aaron Lauda makes this fact into a precise theorem in his
paper on planar open string field theories, and then generalizes it to
consider "categorified" Frobenius algebras where the above equations
are replaced by isomorphisms, which describe the *process* of warping
the sheet of rubber until the left side looks like the right. You should
look at his paper even if you don't understand the math, because it's
full of cool pictures.

Lauda and Pfeiffer's paper goes still further, by considering these
paint stripes as "open strings", not living in the plane anymore, but
zipping around in some spacetime of high dimension, where they might as
well be abstract 2-manifolds with corners. Following Moore and Segal,
they also bring "closed strings" into the game, which form a Frobenius
algebra of their own, where the multiplication looks like an upside-down
pair of pants:
$$
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \draw[thick] (-3,0) ellipse (2cm and 1cm);
    \draw[thick] (3,0) ellipse (2cm and 1cm);
    \draw[thick] (-5,0) .. controls (-5,-2) and (-2,-4) .. (-2,-6);
    \draw[thick] (5,0) .. controls (5,-2) and (2,-4) .. (2,-6);
    \draw[thick] (-1,0) .. controls (-1,-1) .. (0,-2);
    \draw[thick] (1,0) .. controls (1,-1) .. (0,-2);
    \begin{scope}[shift={(0,-6)}]
      \draw[thick,dashed] (0:2) arc (0:180:2cm and 1cm);
      \draw[thick] (180:2) arc (180:360:2cm and 1cm);
    \end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
$$
These topological closed strings are the subject of Joachim Kock's book
mentioned in ["Week 202"](#week202); they correspond to
*commutative* Frobenius algebras. The fun new stuff comes from letting
the open strings and closed strings interact.

You can read more about Lauda and Pfeiffer's work at Urs Schreiber's
blog:

17) Urs Schreiber, "Lauda and Pfeiffer on open-closed topological strings", `http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000680.html`

In fact, I recommend Schreiber's blog quite generally to anyone
interested in higher categories and/or the math of string theory!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Addendum:** Bruce Smith, David Rusin and Robert Lupton had some
comments about the astronomy section; Urs Schreiber had more to say
about the role of Frobenius algebras in string theory.

Bruce Smith picked up on my comment about accretion disks being common
at many different scales, and wondered what the smallest accretion disks
are. We talked about it and agreed that hurricanes, tornados, dust
devils and whirlpools are *related* phenomena, but not true accretion
disks.

Given this, the smallest accretion disks I know are those that led to
the formation of planets in our Solar System, and perhaps even some
moons. These probably began as eddies in the bigger accretion disk that
became our Sun. The Sun is about 300,00 times heavier than the Earth,
and the super-massive black hole in M87 is about 3 billion times heavier
than the Sun, so we're seeing accretion disks that differ in mass by a
factor of a trillion!

David Rusin's reaction to Hoag's object was:

He asked how many ring galaxies are known!

I checked and read there are 100 known "polar-ring galaxies". Here's
a nice one called NGC 4650:

I can imagine this thing looking like Hoag's object if we viewed it
head-on.

Here's another ring galaxy, called AM 0644-741:
$$\href{http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2004/15/image/a}{\includegraphics[max width=0.65\linewidth]{../images/AM0644-741.jpg}}$$

It's the result of a collision involving a galaxy that's not in this
picture. So, maybe Hoag's object is just a specially pretty case of a
galaxy collision!

Robert Lupton referred me to a picture that covers more of the Virgo
Cluster --- but the file is huge, so I won't include it here:

20) Doug Finkbeiner and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Consortium, "Some pretty objects as observed by the SDSS: Virgo Cluster", `http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/dfink`

See the lower right corner for the picture called "virgobig".

Here's what Urs Schreiber had to say about Frobenius algebras and
string theory:

Here's the paper Urs refers to:
