# July 25, 2004 {#week207}

I'm spending the summer in Cambridge, but last week I was in Dublin
attending "GR17", which is short for the 17th International Conference
on General Relativity and Gravitation:

1) GR17 homepage, `http://www.dcu.ie/~nolanb/gr17.htm`

This is where Stephen Hawking decided to announce his solution of the
black hole information loss problem. Hawking is a media superstar right
up there with Einstein and Michael Jackson, so when reporters heard
about this, the ensuing hoopla overshadowed everything else in the
conference.

As soon I arrived, one of the organizers complained to me that they'd
had to spend 4000 pounds on a public relations firm to control the
reporters and other riff-raff who would try to attend Hawking's talk.
Indeed, there seemed to be more than the usual number of crackpots
floating about, though I admit I haven't been to this particular series
of conferences before - perhaps general relativity attracts such people?
The public lecture by Penrose on the last day of the conference may have
helped lure them in. He spoke on "Fashion, Faith and Fantasy in
Theoretical Physics", and people by the door sold copies of his brand
new thousand-page blockbuster:

2) Roger Penrose, The Road To Reality: A Complete Guide to the Physical
Universe, Jonathan Cape, 2004.

(You may enjoy guessing which popular theories he classified under the
three categories of fashion, faith and fantasy.) After his talk, *all*
the questions were actually harangues from people propounding
idiosyncratic theories of their own, and the question period was drawn
to an abrupt halt in the middle of one woman's rant about fractal
cosmology. But I bumped into the saddest example when I was having a
chat with some colleagues at a local pub. A fellow with long curly grey
locks and round horn-rimmed glasses sat down beside me. I'd seen him
around the conference, so I said hello. He asked me if I'd like to hear
about his theory; at this point my internal alarm bells started ringing.
I told him I was busy, but said I'd take a look at his manuscript
later.

It turned out to describe an idea I'd never even dreamt of before: a
heliocentric cosmology in which the planets move along circular orbits
with epicycles a la Ptolemy! And his evidence comes from a neolithic
Irish tomb called Newgrange. This tomb may have been aligned to let in
the sun on the winter solstice, but some people doubt this, because it
seems the alignment would have been slightly off back in 3200 BC when
Newgrange was built. However, it's slightly off only if you work out
the precession of the equinox using standard astronomy. If you use his
theory, it lines up perfectly! Pretty cute. The only problem is that his
paper contains no evidence for this claim. Instead, it's only a short
note sketching the idea, followed by lengthy attachments containing his
correspondence with the Dublin police. In these, he complained that
people were trying to block his patent on a refrigerator that produces
no waste heat. They were constantly flying airplanes over his house, and
playing pranks like boiling water in his teakettle when he was away,
trying to drive him insane.

Anyway, on Wednesday the 21st the whole situation built to a head when
Hawking gave his talk in the grand concert hall of the Royal Dublin
Society. As we had been warned, the PR firm checked our badges at the
door. Reporters with press badges were also allowed in, so the aisles
were soon lined with cameras and recording equipment. I got there half
an hour early to get a good seat, and while I was waiting, Jenny Hogan
from the New Scientist asked if she could interview me for my reaction
afterwards. In short, a thoroughly atypical physics talk!

But you shouldn't imagine the mood as one of breathless anticipation.
At least for the physicists present, a better description would be
something like "skeptical curiosity". None of them seemed to believe
that Hawking could suddenly shed new light on a problem that has been
attacked from many angles for several decades. One reason is that
Hawking's best work was done almost 30 years ago. A string theorist I
know said that thanks to work relating anti-deSitter space and conformal
field theory - the so-called "AdS-CFT" hypothesis - string theorists
had become convinced that no information is lost by black holes. Thus,
Hawking had been feeling strong pressure to fall in line and renounce
his previous position, namely that information *is* lost. A talk
announcing this would come as no big surprise.

After a while Kip Thorne, John Preskill, Petros Florides and Hawking's
grad student Christophe Galfard came on stage. Then, amid a burst of
flashbulbs, Hawking's wheelchair gradually made its way down the aisle
and up a ramp, attended by a nurse - possibly his wife, I don't know.
He had been recently sick with pneumonia.

Once Hawking was on stage, the conference organizer Petros Florides made
an introduction, joking that while physicists believe no information can
travel faster than light, this seems to have been contradicted by the
speed with which the announcement of Hawking's talk spread around the
globe. Then he recalled the famous bet that Preskill made with Hawking
and Thorne. In case you don't know, John Preskill is a leader in
quantum computation at Caltech. Kip Thorne is an expert on relativity,
also at Caltech, one of the authors of the famous textbook
"Gravitation", and now playing a key role in the LIGO project to
detect gravitational waves.

The [bet](dublin/index.html#hawking) went like this:

> Whereas Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne firmly believe that information
> swallowed by a black hole is forever hidden from the outside universe,
> and can never be revealed even as the black hole evaporates and
> completely disappears,
>
> And whereas John Preskill firmly believes that a mechanism for the

>
> Therefore Preskill offers, and Hawking/Thorne accept, a wager that:

It's signed by Thorne and Preskill, with a thumbprint of Hawking's.

After a bit of joking around and an explanation of how the question
session would work, Hawking began his talk. Since it's fairly short and
not too easy to summarize, I think I'll just quote the whole transcript
which I believe Sean Carroll got from the New York Times science
reporter Dennis Overbye. I've made a few small corrections.

There were also some slides, but you're not missing a lot by not seeing
them. The talk was not easy to understand, so unless quantum gravity is
your specialty you may feel like just skimming it to get the flavor, and
then reading my attempt at a summary.

The talk began with Hawking's trademark introduction, uttered as usual
in his computer-generated voice:

At this point the encyclopedia was brought on stage and given to John
Preskill, who [waved it over his head in a parody of athletic
triumph](dublin/index.html#preskill). The order of events is a bit fuzzy
in my mind, but sometime around then he said "I always hoped that when
Stephen conceded, there would be a witness - this really exceeds my
expectations."

After this, Kip Thorne ran a question and answer period, saying that he
would alternate between questions from conference participants, which
Hawking's grad student would answer, and questions from the press,
which Hawking would answer - after Thorne checked Hawking's facial
expressions to see whether he felt they were worth answering.

First, a correspondent from the BBC asked Stephen Hawking what the
significance of this result was for "life, the universe and
everything". (Here I'm using John Preskill's humorous paraphrase.)
Hawking agreed to answer this, and while he began laboriously composing
a reply using the computer system on his wheelchair, his grad student
Christophe Galfard fielded three questions from experts: Bill Unruh,
Gary Horowitz and Robb Mann. I didn't find the replies terribly
illuminating, except that when asked if information would be lost if we
kept feeding the black hole matter to keep it from evaporating away,
Galfard said "yes". Everyone afterwards commented on what a tough job
it would be for a student to field questions in front of about 800
physicists and the international press.

At this point Kip Thorne checked to see if Hawking was done composing
his reply. He was not. To fill time, Thorne explained why he hadn't yet
conceded the bet, saying "This looks to me, on the face of it, to be a
lovely argument. But I haven't seen all the details." He took this
opportunity to tell the reporters a bit about how science was done: we
don't just listen to Hawking and take his word for everything, we have
to go off and check things ourselves. He told a nice story about how
when Hawking first showed that black holes radiate, everyone with their
own approach to quantum field theory on curved spacetime needed to redo
this calculation their own way to be convinced - with Yakov Zeldovich,
who'd gotten the game started by showing that energy could be extracted
from *rotating* black holes in the form of radiation, being one of the
very last to agree! Preskill chimed in, saying "I'll be honest - I
didn't understand the talk", and that he too would need to see more
details.

After a bit more of this sort of thing, Hawking was ready to answer the
BBC reporter's question. His answer was surprisingly short, and it went
something like this (I can't find an exact quote): "This result shows
that everything in the universe is governed by the laws of physics." A
suitably grandiose answer for a grandiose question! One can imagine
better explanations of unitarity, but not quicker ones.

At this point Kip Thorne solicited more questions from the press but
said they should confine themselves to yes-or-no questions, so Hawking
could answer them more efficiently. Jenny Hogan got the first question,
asking what Hawking would do now that he'd solved this problem. Kip
Thorne pointed out that this was not a yes-or-no question. Hogan replied
that it shouldn't take long to reply; Thorne was doubtful, but in the
midst of the ensuing conversation Hawking shot off an unexpectedly rapid
response: "I don't know." Everyone laughed, and at this point the
public question period was called to a close, though reporters were
allowed to stay and pester Hawking some more.

At the time Hawking's talk seemed very cryptic to me, but in the
process of editing the above transcript it's become a lot clearer, so
I'll try to give a quick explanation.

I should start by saying that the jargon used in this talk, while
doubtless obscure to most people, is actually quite standard and not
very difficult to anyone who has spent some time studying the Euclidean
path integral approach to quantum gravity. The problem is not the jargon
so much as the lack of detail, which requires some imagination to fill
in. When I first heard the talk, this lack of detail had me completely
stumped. But now it makes a little more sense....

He's studying the process of creating a black hole and letting it
evaporate away. He's imagining studying this in the usual style of
particle physics, as a "scattering experiment", where we throw in a
bunch of particles and see what comes out. Here we throw in a bunch of
particles, let them form a black hole, let the black hole evaporate
away, and examine the particles (typically photons for the most part)
that shoot out.

The rules of the game in a "scattering experiment" are that we can
only talk about what's going on "at infinity", meaning very far from
where the black hole forms - or more precisely, where it may or may not
form!

The advantage of this is that physics at infinity can be described
without the full machinery of quantum gravity: we don't have to worry
about quantum fluctuations of the geometry of spacetime messing up our
ability to say where things are. The disadvantage is that we can't
actually say for sure whether or not a black hole formed. At least this
*seems* like a "disadvantage" at first - but a better term for it
might be a "subtlety", since it's crucial for resolving the puzzle:

> Black hole formation and evaporation can be thought of as a scattering
> process. One sends in particles and radiation from infinity, and

> region in the middle. So one can't be sure a black hole forms, no
> matter how certain it might be in classical theory. I shall show that
> this possibility allows information to be preserved and to be returned
> to infinity.

Now, the way Hawking likes to calculate things in this sort of problem
is using a "Euclidean path integral". This is a rather controversial
approach - hence his grin when he said it's the "only sane way" to do
these calculations - but let's not worry about that. Suffice it to say
that we replace the time variable "t" in all our calculations by
"it", do a bunch of calculations, and then replace "it" by "t"
again at the end. This trick is called "Wick rotation". In the middle
of this process, we hope all our formulas involving the geometry of 4d
*spacetime* have magically become formulas involving the geometry of 4d
*space*. The answers to physical questions are then expressed as
integrals over all geometries of 4d space that satisfy some conditions
depending on the problem we're studying. This integral over geometries
also includes a sum over topologies.

That's what Hawking means by this:

> I adopt the Euclidean approach, the only sane way to do quantum
> gravity non-perturbatively. In this, the time evolution of an initial
> state is given by a path integral over all positive definite metrics
> that go between two surfaces that are a distance T apart at infinity.
> One then Wick rotates the time interval, T, to the Lorentzian. The
> path integral is taken over metrics of all possible topologies that
> fit in between the surfaces.

Unfortunately, nobody knows how to define these integrals. However,
physicists like Hawking are usually content to compute them in a
"semiclassical approximation". This means integrating not over all
geometries, but only those that are close to some solution of the
classical equations of general relativity. We can then do a clever
approximation to get a closed-form answer.

(Nota bene: here I'm talking about the equations of general relativity
on 4d *space*, not 4d spacetime. That's because we're in the middle of
this Wick rotation trick.)

Actually, I'm oversimplifying a bit. We don't get "the answer" to
our physics question this way: we get one answer for each solution of
the equations of general relativity that we deem relevant to the problem
at hand. To finish the job, we should add up all these partial answers
to get the total answer. But in practice this last step is always too
hard: there are too many topologies, and too many classical solutions,
to keep track of them all.

So what do we do? We just add up a few of the answers, cross our
fingers, and hope for the best! If this procedure offends you, go do
something easy like math.

In the problem at hand here, Hawking focuses on two classical solutions,
or more precisely two classes of them. One describes a spacetime with no
black hole, the other describes a spacetime with a black hole which
lasts forever. Each one gives a contribution to the semiclassical
approximation of the integral over all geometries. To get answers to
physical questions, he needs to sum over *both*. In principle he should
sum over infinitely many others, too, but nobody knows how, so he's
probably hoping the crux of the problem can be understood by considering
just these two.

He says that if you just do the integral over geometries near the
classical solution where there's no black hole, you'll find -
unsurprisingly - that no information is lost as time passes.

He also says that if you do the integral over geometries near the
classical solution where there is a black hole, you'll find -
surprisingly - that the answer is *zero* for a lot of questions you can
measure the answers to far from the black hole. In physics jargon, this
is because a bunch of "correlation functions decay exponentially".

So, when you add up both answers to see if information is lost in the
real problem, where you can't be sure if there's a black hole or not,
you get the same answer as if there were no black hole!

The mysterious part is why the geometries near the classical solution
where there's a black hole don't contribute at all to information
loss, even though they do contribute to other important things, like the
Hawking radiation. Here I'd need to see an actual calculation. Hawking
gives a nice hand-wavy topological argument, but that's not enough for
me.

Since this issue is long enough already and I want to get it out soon, I
won't talk about other things that happened at this conference - nor
will I talk about the conference on $n$-categories earlier this summer! I
just want to say a few elementary things about the topology lurking in
Hawking's talk... since some mathematicians may enjoy it.

As he points out, the answers to a bunch of questions diverge unless we
put our black hole in a box of finite size. A convenient way to do this
is to introduce a small negative cosmological constant, which changes
our default picture of spacetime from Minkowski spacetime, which is
topologically R^4, to anti-deSitter spacetime, which is topologically R
x D^3 after we add the "boundary at infinity". Here R is time and the
3-disk D^3 is space. This is a Lorentzian manifold with boundary, but
when we do Wick rotation we get a Riemannian manifold with boundary
having the same topology.

However, when we are doing Euclidean path integrals at nonzero
temperature, we should replace the time line R here by a circle whose
radius is the reciprocal of that temperature. (Take my word for it!) So
now our Riemannian manifold with boundary is S^1 x D^3. This is what
Hawking uses to handle the geometries without a black hole. The boundary
of this manifold is S^1 x S^2. But there's another obvious manifold
with this boundary, namely D^2 x S2. And this corresponds to the
geometries with a black hole! This is cute because we see it all the
time in surgery theory. In fact I commented on Hawking's use of this
idea a long time ago, in ["Week 67"](#week67).

In his talk, Hawking points out that S^1 x D^3 has a nontrivial
3-cycle in it if we use relative cohomology and work relative to the
boundary S^1 x S^2. But, D^2 x S^2 does not. When spacetime is
n-dimensional, conservation laws usually come from integrating closed
(n-1)-forms over cycles that correspond to "space", so we get
interesting conservation laws when there are nontrivial $(n-1)$-cycles.
Here Hawking is using this to argue for conservation of information when
there's no black hole - namely for S^1 x D^3 - but not when there is,
namely for D^2 x S^2.

All this is fine and dandy; the hard part is to see why the case when
there *is* a black hole doesn't screw things up! This is where his
allusions to "exponentially decaying correlation functions come in" -
and this is where I'd like to see more details. I guess a good place to
start is Maldacena's papers on the black hole in 3d spacetime - the
so-called Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli or "BTZ" black hole. This is a
baby version of the problem, one dimension down from the real thing,
where everything should get much simpler. For a bunch about the BTZ
black hole, try:

**Addendum:** My friend Ted Bunn filled a gap in my understanding of the
history of astronomy. I had written:

    It turned out to describe an idea I'd never even dreamt of before: 
    a heliocentric cosmology in which the planets move along circular orbits 
    with epicycles a la Ptolemy!  

to which he replied:

    There is nothing new under (or orbiting) the Sun.  This idea is
    originally due to Copernicus.  Thomas Kuhn's book "The Copernican
    Revolution" has a nice discussion.

In retrospect it's obvious that *someone* had to try this idea before
Kepler came up with elliptical heliocentric orbits. In fact, Kepler
tried ellipses only because the epicycle theory didn't work well for
Mars.
