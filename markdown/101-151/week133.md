I'd like to start with a long quote from a paper by Ashtekar:

1) Abhay Ashtekar, Quantum Mechanics of Geometry, preprint available as
[gr-qc/9901023](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9901023).

I feel like quoting more, but I'll resist. It's a nice semi-technical
introduction to loop quantum gravity - a very good place to start if you
know some math and physics but are just getting started on the quantum
gravity business.

Next, here are some papers by younger folks working on loop quantum
gravity:

2) Fotini Markopoulou, The internal description of a causal set: What
the universe looks like from the inside, preprint available as
[gr-qc/9811053](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9811053).

Fotini Markopoulou, Quantum causal histories, preprint available as
[hep-th/9904009](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9904009).

Fotini Markopoulou is perhaps the first person to take the issue of
causality really seriously in loop quantum gravity. In her earlier work
with Lee Smolin (see ["Week 99"](#week99) and
["Week 114"](#week114)) she proposed a way to equip an evolving
spin network (or what I'd call a spin foam) with a partial order on its
vertices, representing a causal structure. In these papers she is
further developing these ideas. The first one uses topos theory! It's
good to see brave young physicists who aren't scared of using a little
category theory here and there to make their ideas precise. Personally I
feel confused about causality in loop quantum gravity - I think we'll
have to muck around and try different things before we find out what
works. But Markopoulou's work is the main reason I'm even *daring* to
think about these issues\....

3) Seth A. Major, Embedded graph invariants in Chern-Simons theory,
preprint available as
[hep-th/9810071](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9810071).

In This Week's Finds I've already mentioned Seth Major has worked with
Lee Smolin on q-deformed spin networks in quantum gravity (see
["Week 72"](#week72)). There is a fair amount of evidence, though
as yet no firm proof, that q-deforming your spin networks corresponds to
introducing a nonzero cosmological constant. The main technical problem
with q-deformed spin networks is that they require a "framing" of the
underlying graph. Here Major tackles that problem\....

And now for something completely different, arising from a thread on
sci.physics.research started by Garrett Lisi. What's the gauge group of
the Standard Model? Everyone will tell you it's U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3),
but as Marc Bellon pointed out, this is perhaps not the most accurate
answer. Let me explain why and figure out a better answer.

Every particle in the Standard Model transforms according to some
representation of U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3), but some elements of this group
act trivially on all these representations. Thus we can find a smaller
group which can equally well be used as the gauge group of the Standard
Model: the quotient of U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3) by the subgroup of elements
that act trivially.

Let's figure out this subgroup! To do so we need to go through all the
particles and figure out which elements of U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3) act
trivially on all of them.

Start with the gauge bosons. In any gauge theory, the gauge bosons
transform in the adjoint representation, so the elements of the gauge
group that act trivially are precisely those in the *center* of the
group. U(1) is abelian so its center is all of U(1). Elements of SU(n)
that lie in the center must be diagonal. The n x n diagonal unitary
matrices with determinant 1 are all of the form exp(2 π i / n), and
these form a subgroup isomorphic to Z/n. It follows that the center of
U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3) is U(1) x Z/2 x Z/3.

Next let's look at the other particles. If you forget how these work,
see ["Week 119"](#week119). For the fermions, it suffices to look
at those of the first generation, since the other two generations
transform exactly the same way. First of all, we have the left-handed
electron and neutrino:

(ν_L, e_L)

These form a 2-dimensional representation. This representation is the
tensor product of the irreducible rep of U(1) with hypercharge -1, the
isospin-1/2 rep of SU(2), and the trivial rep of SU(3).

A word about notation! People usually describe irreducible reps of U(1)
by integers. For historical reasons, hypercharge comes in integral
multiples of 1/3. Thus to get the appropriate integer we need to
multiply the hypercharge by 3. Also, the group SU(2) here is associated,
not to spin in the sense of angular momentum, but to something called
"weak isospin". That's why we say "isopin-1/2 rep" above.
Mathematically, though, this is just the usual spin-1/2 representation
of SU(2).

Next we have the left-handed up and down quarks, which come in 3 colors
each:

(u_L, u_L, u_L, d_L, d_L, d_L)

This 6-dimensional representation is the tensor product of the
irreducible rep of U(1) with hypercharge 1/3, the isospin-1/2 rep of
SU(2), and the fundamental rep of SU(3).

That's all the left-handed fermions. Note that they all transform
transform according to the isospin-1/2 rep of SU(2) - we call them
"isospin doublets". The right-handed fermions all transform according
to the isospin-0 rep of SU(2) - they're "isospin singlets". First we
have the right-handed electron:

e_R

This is the tensor product of the irreducible rep of U(1) with
hypercharge -2, the isospin-0 rep of SU(2), and the trivial rep of
SU(3). Then there are the right-handed up quarks:

(u_R, u_R, u_R)

which form the tensor product of the irreducible rep of U(1) with
hypercharge 4/3, the isospin-0 rep of SU(2), and the fundamental rep of
SU(3). And then there are the right-handed down quarks:

(d_R, d_R, d_R)

which form the tensor product of the irreducible rep of U(1) with
hypercharge 2/3, the isospin-0 rep of SU(2), and the 3-dimensional
fundamental rep of SU(3).

Finally, besides the fermions, there is the - so far unseen - Higgs
boson:

(H\_+, H_0)

This transforms according to the tensor product of the irreducible rep
of U(1) with hypercharge 1, the isospin-1/2 rep of SU(2), and the
1-dimensional trivial rep of SU(3).

Okay, let's see which elements of U(1) x Z/2 x Z/3 act trivially on all
these representations! Note first that the generator of Z/2 acts as
multiplication by 1 on the isospin singlets and -1 on the isospin
doublets. Similarly, the generator of Z/3 acts as multiplication by 1 on
the leptons and exp(2 π i / 3) on the quarks. Thus everything in Z/2 x
Z/3 acts as multiplication by some sixth root of unity. So to find
elements of U(1) x Z/2 x Z/3 that act trivially, we only need to
consider guys in U(1) that are sixth roots of unity.

To see what's going on, we make a little table using the information
I've described:


             ACTION OF            ACTION OF             ACTION OF
           exp(π i / 3)            -1               exp(2 π i / 3)
              IN U(1)             IN SU(2)               IN SU(3)

    e_L         -1                  -1                     1
    ν_L        -1                  -1                     1
    u_L     exp(π i / 3)           -1               exp(2 π i / 3)
    d_L     exp(π i / 3)           -1               exp(2 π i / 3)

    e_R          1                   1                     1
    u_R     exp(4 π i / 3)          1               exp(2 π i / 3)
    d_R     exp(4 π i / 3)          1               exp(2 π i / 3)


     H          -1                  -1                     1

And we look for patterns!

See any?

The most important one for our purposes is that if we multiply all three
numbers in each row, we get 1.

This means that the element (exp(π i / 3), -1, exp(2 π i / 3)) in U(1) x
SU(2) x SU(3) acts trivially on all particles. This element generates a
subgroup isomorphic to Z/6. If you think a bit harder you'll see there
are no *other* patterns that would make any *more* elements of U(1) x
SU(2) x SU(3) act trivially. And if you think about the relation between
charge and hypercharge, you'll see this pattern has a lot to do with
the fact that quark charges in multiples of 1/3, while leptons have
integral charge. There's more to it than that, though\....

Anyway, the "true" gauge group of the Standard Model - i.e., the
smallest possible one - is not U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3), but the quotient of
this by the particular Z/6 subgroup we've just found. Let's call this
group G.

There are two reasons why this might be important. First, Marc Bellon
pointed out a nice way to think about G: it's the subgroup of U(2) x
U(3) consisting of elements (g,h) with

(det g)(det h) = 1.

If we embed U(2) x U(3) in U(5) in the obvious way, then this subgroup G
actually lies in SU(5), thanks to the above equation. And this is what
people do in the SU(5) grand unified theory. They don't actually stuff
all of U(1) x SU(2) x SU(3) into SU(5), just the group G! For more
details, see ["Week 119"](#week119). Better yet, try this book that
Brett McInnes recommended to me:

4) Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh, Group structure of gauge theories,
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1986.

Second, this magical group G has a nice action on a 7-dimensional
manifold which we can use as the fiber for a 11-dimensional Kaluza-Klein
theory that mimics the Standard Model in the low-energy limit. The way
to get this manifold is to take S\^3 x S\^5 sitting inside C\^2 x C\^3
and mod out by the action of U(1) as multiplication by phases. The group
G acts on C\^2 x C\^3 in an obvious way, and using this it's easy to
see that it acts on (C\^2 x C\^3)/U(1).

I'm not sure where to read more about this, but you might try:
