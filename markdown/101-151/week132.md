week132

Today I want to talk about n-categories and quantum gravity again. For
starters let me quote from a paper of mine about this stuff:

1\) John Baez, Higher-dimensional algebra and Planck-scale physics, to
appear in Physics Meets Philosophy at the Planck Scale, eds. Craig
Callender and Nick Huggett, Cambridge U. Press. Preprint available as
[gr-qc/9902017](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9902017).

By the way, this book should be pretty fun to read - it\'ll contain
papers by both philosophers and physicists, including a bunch who have
already graced the pages of This Week\'s Finds, like Barbour, Isham,
Rovelli, Unruh, and Witten. I\'ll say more about it when it comes out.

Okay, here are some snippets from this paper. It starts out talking
about the meaning of the Planck length, why it may be important in
quantum gravity, and what a theory of quantum gravity should be like:

> Two constants appear throughout general relativity: the speed of light
> c and Newton\'s gravitational constant G. This should be no surprise,
> since Einstein created general relativity to reconcile the success of
> Newton\'s theory of gravity, based on instantaneous action at a
> distance, with his new theory of special relativity, in which no
> influence travels faster than light. The constant c also appears in
> quantum field theory, but paired with a different partner: Planck\'s
> constant ħ. The reason is that quantum field theory takes into account
> special relativity and quantum theory, in which ħ sets the scale at
> which the uncertainty principle becomes important.
>
> It is reasonable to suspect that any theory reconciling general
> relativity and quantum theory will involve all three constants c, G,
> and ħ. Planck noted that apart from numerical factors there is a
> unique way to use these constants to define units of length, time, and
> mass. For example, we can define the unit of length now called the
> \`Planck length\' as follows:
>
> L = sqrt(ħ G /c\^3)
>
> This is extremely small: about 1.6 x 10\^{-35} meters. Physicists have
> long suspected that quantum gravity will become important for
> understanding physics at about this scale. The reason is very simple:
> any calculation that predicts a length using only the constants c, G
> and ħ must give the Planck length, possibly multiplied by an
> unimportant numerical factor like 2π.

Then I talk about topological quantum field theories, which are
background-free quantum theories *without* local degrees of freedom, and
what we have learned from them. Basically what we\'ve learned is that
there\'s a deep analogy between the mathematics of spacetime (e.g.
differential topology) and the mathematics of quantum theory. This is
interesting because in background-free quantum theories we expect that
spacetime, instead of serving as a \"stage\" on which events play out,
actually becomes part of the play of events itself - and must itself be
described using quantum theory. So it\'s very interesting to try to
connect the concepts of spacetime and quantum theory. The analogy goes
like this:


         DIFFERENTIAL TOPOLOGY                  QUANTUM THEORY            

      (n-1)-dimensional manifold                Hilbert space             
              (space)                             (states)                  

    cobordism between (n-1)-dimensional           operator    
              manifolds                           (process)                 
             (spacetime)                         

      composition of cobordisms            composition of operators  

          identity cobordism                  identity operator         

And if you know a little category theory, you\'ll see what we have here
are two categories: the category of cobordisms and the category of
Hilbert spaces. A topological quantum field theory is a functor from the
first to the second\....

Okay, now for some other papers:

Charles Peirce is a famously underappreciated American philosopher who
worked in the late 1800s. Among other things, like being the father of
pragmatism, he is also one of the fathers of higher-dimensional algebra.
As you surely know if you\'ve read me often enough, part of the point of
higher-dimensional algebra is to break out of \"linear thinking\". By
\"linear thinking\" I mean the tendency to do mathematics in ways that
are easily expressed in terms of 1-dimensional strings of symbols. In
his work on logic, Peirce burst free into higher dimensions. He
developed a way of reasoning using diagrams that he called \"existential
graphs\". Unfortunately this work by Peirce was never published! One
reason is that existential graphs were difficult and expensive to print.
As a result, his ideas languished in obscurity.

By now it\'s clear that higher-dimensional algebra is useful in physics:
examples include Feynman diagrams and the spin networks of Penrose. The
theory of n-categories is beginning to provide a systematic language for
all these techniques. So it\'s worth re-evaluating Peirce\'s work and
seeing how it fits into the picture. And this is what the papers by
Brady and Trimble do!

and diagrammatics of four dimensional topological lattice field
theories, to appear in Adv. Math., preprint available as
[math.GT/9806023](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.GT/9806023).

We can get 3-dimensional topological quantum field theories from certain
Hopf algebras. As I described in \"[week38](week38.html)\", Crane and
Frenkel made the suggestion that by categorifying this construction we
should get 4-dimensional TQFTs from certain Hopf categories. This paper
makes the suggestion precise in a certain class of examples! Basically
these are categorified versions of the Dijkgraaf-Witten theory.

Yet another attack on higher dimensions! This one gets invariants of
2-links - surfaces embedded in R\^4 - from the cohomology groups of
\"quandles\". I don\'t really understand how this fits into the overall
scheme of higher-dimensional algebra yet. They show their invariant
distinguishes between the 2-twist spun trefoil (a certain sphere knotted
in R\^4) and the same sphere with the reversed orientation.

This is a nice tour of ideas in higher-dimensional algebra. Right now
one big problem with the subject is that there are lots of approaches
and not a clear enough picture of how they fit together. Leinster\'s
paper is an attempt to start seeing how things fit together.

For quite a while now James Dolan and I have been talking about
something we call the \"stabilization hypothesis\". I gave an
explanation of this in \"[week121](week121.html)\", but briefly, it says
that the nth column of the following chart (which extends to infinity in
both directions) stabilizes after 2n+2 rows:

                       k-tuply monoidal n-categories

Carlos Simpson has now made this hypothesis precise and proved it using
Tamsamani\'s definition of n-categories! And he did it using the same
techniques that Graeme Segal used to study k-fold loop spaces\...
exploiting the relation between n-categories and homotopy theory. This
makes me really happy.

A Gray-category is what some people call a semistrict 3-category: not as
general as a weak 3-category, but general enough. Technically,
Gray-categories are defined as categories enriched over the category of
2-categories equipped with a tensor product invented by John Gray. To
define semistrict 4-categories one might similarly try to equip
Gray-categories with a suitable tensor product. And this is what Crans
is studying. Let me quote the abstract:
