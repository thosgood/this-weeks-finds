# February 14, 1998 {#week117}

A true physicist loves matter in all its states. The phases we all
learned about in school - solid, liquid, and gas - are just the
beginning of the story! There lots of others: liquid crystal, plasma,
superfluid, and neutronium, for example. Today I want to say a little
about two more phases that people are trying to create: quark-gluon
plasma and strange quark matter. The first almost certainly exists; the
second is a matter of much discussion.

1) The E864 Collaboration, Search for charged strange quark matter

Last week I went to a talk on the search for strange quark matter by one
of these collaborators, Kenneth Barish. This talk was based on Barish's
work at the E864 experiment at the "AGS", the alternating gradient
synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island, New York.

What's "strange quark matter"? Well, first remember from
["Week 93"](#week93) that in the Standard Model there are bosonic
particles that carry forces:

        ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE          WEAK FORCE         STRONG FORCE
            
        photon                          W+                  8 gluons 
                                        W-
                                        Z  

and fermionic particles that constitute matter:

            LEPTONS                                     QUARKS

    electron        electron neutrino         down quark        up quark
    muon            muon neutrino             strange quark     charm quark
    tauon           tauon neutrino            bottom quark      top quark

(There is also the mysterious Higgs boson, which has not yet been seen.)

The quarks and leptons come in 3 generations each. The only quarks in
ordinary matter are the lightest two, those from the first generation:
the up and down. These are the constituents of protons and neutrons,
which are the only stable particles made of quarks. A proton consists of
two ups and a down held together by the strong force, while a neutron
consists of two downs and a up. The up has electric charge +2/3, while
the down has electric charge -1/3. They also interact via the strong and
weak forces.

The other quarks are more massive and decay via the weak interaction
into up and down quarks. Apart from that, however, they are quite
similar. There are lots of short-lived particles made of various
combinations of quarks. All the combinations we've seen so far are of
two basic sorts. There are "baryons", which consist of 3 quarks, and
"mesons", which consist of a quark and an antiquark. Both of these
should be visualized roughly as a sort of bag with the quarks and a
bunch of gluons confined inside.

Why are they confined? Well, I sketched an explanation in
["Week 94"](#week94), so you should read that for more details. For
now let's just say the strong force likes to "stick together", so
that energy is minimized if it stays concentrated in small regions,
rather than spreading all over the place, like the electromagnetic field
does. Indeed, the strong force may even do something like this in the
absence of quarks, forming short-lived "glueballs" consisting solely
of gluons and virtual quark-antiquark pairs. (For more on glueballs, see
["Week 68"](#week68).)

For reasons I don't really understand, the protons and neutrons in the
nucleus do not coalesce into one big bag of quarks. Even in a neutron
star, the quarks stay confined in their individual little bags. But
calculations suggest that at sufficiently high temperatures or
pressures, "deconfinement" should occur. Basically, under these
conditions the baryons and mesons either smash into each other so hard,
or get so severely squashed, that they burst open. The result should be
a soup of free quarks and gluons: a "quark-gluon plasma".

To get deconfinement to happen is not easy - at low pressures, it's
expected to occur at a temperature of 2 trillion Kelvin! According to
the conventional wisdom in cosmology, the last time deconfinement was
prevalent was about 1 microsecond after the big bang! In the E864
experiment, they are accelerating gold nuclei to energies of 11.5 GeV
per nucleon and colliding them with a fixed target made of lead, which
is apparently *not* enough energy to fully achieve deconfinement - they
believe they are reaching temperatures of about 1 trillion Kelvin. At
CERN they are accelerating lead nuclei to 160 GeV per nuclei and
colliding them with a lead target. They may be getting signs of
deconfinement, but as Jim Carr explained in a recent post to
sci.physics, they're being very cautious about coming out and saying
so. By mid-1999, the folks at Brookhaven hope to get higher energies
with the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which will collide two beams
of gold nuclei head-on at 100 GeV per nucleon... see
["Week 76"](#week76) for more on this.

One of the hoped-for signs of deconfinement is "strangeness
enhancement". The lightest quark besides the up and down is the strange
quark, and in the high energies present in a quark gluon plasma, strange
quarks should be formed. Moreover, since Pauli exclusion principle
prevents two identical fermions from being in the same state, it can be
energetically favorable to have strange quarks around, since they can
occupy lower-energy states which are already packed with ups and downs.
They seem to be seeing strangeness enhancement at CERN:

sulphur- nucleus collisions at 200 GeV/N, preprint available as
[`hep-ph/9609242`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9609242).

As far as I can tell, people are just about as sure that deconfinement
occurs at high temperatures as they would be that tungsten boils at high
temperatures, even if they've never actually seen it happen. A more
speculative possibility is that as quark-gluon plasma cools down it
forms "strange quark matter" in the form of "strangelets": big bags
of up, down, and strange quarks. This is what they're looking for at
E864. Their experiment would only detect strangelets that live long
enough to get to the detector. When their experiment is running they get
10^6 collisions per second. So far they've set an upper bound of
10^{-7} charged strangelets per collision, neutral strangelets being
harder to detect and rule out. For more on strangelets, try this:

Lett. 71 (1993) 332-335, preprint available as
[`hep-ph/9302270`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9302270).

Strange quark matter is also of interest in astrophysics. In 1984 Witten
wrote a paper proposing that in the limit of large quark number, strange
quark matter could be more stable than ordinary nuclear matter!

4) Edward Witten, Cosmic separation of phases, Phys. Rev. D30 (1984)
272-285.

More recently, a calculation of Farhi and Jaffe estimates that in the
limit of large quark number, the energy of strange quark matter is 301
MeV per quark, as compared with 310 Mev/quark for iron-56, which is the
most stable nucleus. This raises the possibility that under suitable
conditions, a neutron star could collapse to become a "quark star" or
"strange star". Let me quote the abstract of the following paper:

Here are a couple of books on the subject, which unfortunately I've not
been able to get ahold of:

International Workshop on Strange Quark Matter in Physics and
Astrophysics, ed. Jes Madsen, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1991.

7) International Symposium on Strangeness and Quark Matter, eds.
Georges Vassiliadis et al, World Scientific, Singapore, 1995.

If anyone out there knows more about the latest theories of strange
quark matter, and can explain them in simple terms, I'd love to hear
about it.

Okay, enough of that.

Now, on with my tour of homotopy theory!

So far I've mainly been talking about simplicial sets. I described a
functor called "geometric realization" that turns a simplicial set
into a topological space, and another functor that turns a space into a
simplicial set called its "singular simplicial set". I also showed how
to turn a simplicial set into a simplicial abelian group, and how to
turn one of *those* into a chain complex... or vice versa.

As you can see, the key is to have lots of functors at your disposal, so
you can take a problem in any given context - or more precisely, any
given category! - and move it to other contexts where it may be easier
to solve. Eventually I want to talk about what all these categories
we're using have in common: they are all "model categories". Once we
understand that, we'll be able to see more deeply what's going on in
all the games we've been playing.

But first I want to describe a few more important tricks for turning
this into that. Recall from ["Week 115"](#week115) that there's a
category Δ whose objects 0,1,2,... are the simplices, with n
corresponding to the simplex with n vertices - the simplex with 0
vertices being the "empty simplex". We can also define Δ in a purely
algebraic way as the category of finite totally ordered sets, with n
corresponding to the totally ordered set {0,1,....,n-1}. The morphisms
in Δ are then the order-preserving maps. Using this algebraic definition
we can do some cool stuff:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**J.** The Nerve of a Category. This is a trick to turn a category into
a simplicial set. Given a category C, we cook up the simplicial set
Nerve(C) as follows. The 0-dimensional simplices of Nerve(C) are just
the objects of C, which look like this:

                                x

The 1-simplices of Nerve(C) are just the morphisms, which look like
this:

                            x---f-->y

The 2-simplices of Nerve(C) are just the commutative diagrams that look
like this:

                                y
                               / \                 
                              f   g
                             /     \
                            x---h-->z 

where f: x\to y, g: y\to z, and h: x\to z. And so on. In general, the
n-simplices of Nerve(C) are just the commutative diagrams in C that look
like n-simplices!

When I first heard of this idea I cracked up. It seemed like an insane
sort of joke. Turning a category into a kind of geometrical object built
of simplices? What nerve! What use could this possibly be?

Well, for an application of this idea to computer science, see
["Week 70"](#week70). We'll soon see lots of applications within
topology. But first, let me give a slick abstract description of this
"nerve" process that turns categories into simplicial sets. It's
really a functor

Nerve: Cat\to SimpSet

going from the category of categories to the category of simplicial
sets.

First, a remark on Cat. This has categories as objects and functors as
morphisms. Since the "category of all categories" is a bit creepy, we
really want the objects of Cat to be all the "small" categories, i.e.,
those having a mere *set* of objects. This prevents Russell's paradox
from raising its ugly head and disturbing our fun and games.

Next, note that any partially ordered set can be thought of as a
category whose objects are just the elements of our set, and where we
say there's a single morphism from x to y if x \<= y. Composition of
morphisms works out automatically, thanks to the transitivity of "less
than or equal to". We thus obtain a functor

i: Δ\to Cat

taking each finite totally ordered set to its corresponding category,
and each order-preserving map to its corresponding functor.

Now we can copy the trick we played in section F of
["Week 116"](#week116). For any category C we define the simplicial
set Nerve(C) by

Nerve(C)(-) = \operatorname{Hom}(i(-),C)

Think about it! If you put the simplex n in the blank slot, we get
\operatorname{Hom}(i(n),C), which is the set of all functors from that simplex,
*regarded as a category*, to the category C. This is just the set of all
diagrams in C shaped like the simplex n, as desired!

We can say all this even more slickly as follows: take

                                   i x 1                  hom
                     Δop x Cat ------> Catop x Cat -----> Set

and dualize it to obtain

                     Nerve: Cat\to SimpSet.

I should also point out that topologists usually do this stuff with the
topologist's version of Δ, which does not include the "empty
simplex".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**K.** The Classifying Space of Category. If compose our new functor

Nerve: Cat\to SimpSet

with the "geometric realization" functor

| |: SimpSet\to Top

defined in section E, we get a way to turn a category into a space,
called its "classifying space". This trick was first used by Graeme
Segal, the homotopy theorist who later became the guru of conformal
field theory. He invented this trick in the following paper:

8) Graeme B. Segal, Classifying spaces and spectral sequences, Publ.
Math. Inst. des Haut. Etudes Scient. 34 (1968), 105-112.

As it turns out, every reasonable space is the classifying space of some
category! More precisely, every space that's the geometric realization
of some simplicial set is homeomorphic to the classifying space of some
category. To see this, suppose the space X is the geometric realization
of the simplicial set S. Take the set of all simplices in S and
partially order them by saying x \<= y if x is a face of y. Here by
"face" I don't mean just mean a face of one dimension less than that
of y; I'm allowing faces of any dimension less than or equal to that of
y. We obtain a partially ordered set. Now think of this as a category,
C. Then Nerve(C) is the "barycentric subdivision" of S. In other
words, it's a new simplicial set formed by chopping up the simplices of
S into smaller pieces by putting a new vertex in the center of each one.
It follows that the geometric realization of Nerve(C) is homeomorphic to
that of S.

There are lots of interesting special sorts of categories, like
groupoids, or monoids, or groups (see ["Week 74"](#week74)). These
give special cases of the "classifying space" construction, some of
which were actually discovered before the general case. I'll talk about
some of these more next week, since they are very important in topology.

Also sometimes people take categories that they happen to be interested
in, which may have no obvious relation to topology, and study them by
studying their classifying spaces. This gives surprising ways to apply
topology to all sorts of subjects. A good example is "algebraic
K-theory", where we start with some sort of category of modules over a
ring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**L.** Δ as the Free Monoidal Category on a Monoid Object. Recall that a
"monoid" is a set with a product and a unit element satisfying
associativity and the left and right unit laws. Categorifying this
notion, we obtain the concept of a "monoidal category": a category C
with a product and a unit object satisfying the same laws. A nice
example of a monoidal category is the category Set with its usual
cartesian product, or the category Vect with its usual tensor product.
We usually call the product in a monoidal category the "tensor
product".

Now, the "microcosm principle" says that algebraic gadgets often like
to live inside categorified versions of themselves. It's a bit like the
"homunculus theory", where I have a little copy of myself sitting in
my head who looks out through my eyes and thinks all my thoughts for me.
But unlike that theory, it's true!

For example, we can define a "monoid object" in any monoidal category.
Given a monoidal category A with tensor product x and unit object 1, we
define a monoid object a in A to be an object equipped with a
"product"

m: a x a\to a

and a "unit"

i: 1\to a

which satisfy associativity and the left and right unit laws (written
out as commutative diagrams). A monoid object in Set is just a monoid,
but a monoid object in Vect is an algebra, and I gave some very
different examples of monoid objects in ["Week 89"](#week89).

Now let's consider the "free monoidal category on a monoid object".
In other words, consider a monoidal category A with a monoid object a in
it, and assume that A has no objects and no morphisms, and satisfies no
equations, other than those required by the definitions of "monoidal
category" and "monoid object".

Thus the only objects of A are the unit object together with a and its
tensor powers. Similarly, all the morphism of A are built up by
composing and tensoring the morphisms m and i. So A looks like this:

                              1x1xi
                            -------->
                1xi           1xix1
               ----->       -------->
        i       ix1           ix1x1
    1 -----> a -----> a x a --------> a x a x a    ...
                 m             mx1
               <-----       <--------
                               1xm
                            <--------

Here I haven't drawn all the morphisms, just enough so that every
morphism in A is a composite of morphisms of this sort.

What is this category? It's just Δ! The nth tensor power of a
corresponds to the simplex with n vertices. The morphisms going to the
right describe the ways the simplex with n vertices can be a face of the
simplex with n+1 vertices. The morphisms going to the left correspond to
"degeneracies" - ways of squashing a simplex with n+1 vertices down
into one with n vertices.

So: in addition to its other descriptions, we can define Δ as the free
monoidal category on a monoid object! Next time we'll see how this is
fundamental to homological algebra.
