# June 8, 1999 {#week134}

My production of "This Week's Finds" has slowed to a trickle as I've
been struggling to write up a bunch of papers. Deadlines, deadlines! I
hate deadlines, but when you write things for other people, or with
other people, that's what you get into. I'll do my best to avoid them
in the future. Now I'm done with my chores and I want to have some fun.

I spent last weekend with a bunch of people talking about quantum
gravity in a hunting lodge by a lake in Minnowbrook, New York:

1) Minnowbrook Symposium on Space-Time Structure, program and
transparencies of talks available at
`http://www.phy.syr.edu/research/he_theory/minnowbrook/#PROGRAM`

The idea of this get-together, organized by Kameshwar Wali and some
other physicists at Syracuse University, was to bring together people
working on string theory, loop quantum gravity, noncommutative geometry,
and various discrete approaches to spacetime. People from these
different schools of thought don't talk to each other as much as they
should, so this was a good idea. People gave lots of talks, asked lots
of tough questions, argued, and learned what each other were doing. But
I came away with a sense that we're quite far from understanding
quantum gravity: every approach has obvious flaws.

One big problem with string theory is that people only know how to study
it on a spacetime with a fixed background metric. Even worse, things are
poorly understood except when the metric is static - that is, roughly
speaking, when geometry of space does not change with the passage of
time.

For example, people understand a lot about string theory on spacetimes
that are the product of Minkowski spacetime and a fixed Calabi-Yau
manifold. There are lots of Calabi-Yau manifolds, organized in
continuous multi-parameter families called moduli spaces. This suggests
the idea that the geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold could change with
time. This idea is lurking behind a lot of interesting work. For
example, Brian Greene gave a nice talk on "mirror symmetry". Different
Calabi-Yau manifolds sometimes give the same physics; these are called
"mirror manifolds". Because of this, a curve in one moduli space of
Calabi-Yau manifolds can be physically equivalent to a curve in some
other moduli space, which sometimes lets you continue the curve beyond a
singularity in the first moduli space. Physicists like to think of these
curves as representing spacetime geometries where the Calabi-Yau
manifold changes with time. The problem is, there's no fully worked out
version of string theory that allows for a time-dependent Calabi-Yau
manifold!

There's a good reason for this: one shouldn't expect anything so
simple to make sense, except in the "adiabatic approximation" where
things change very slowly with time. The product of Minkowski spacetime
with a fixed Calabi-Yau manifold is a solution of the 10-dimensional
Einstein equations, and this is part of why this kind of spacetime
serves as a good background for string theory. But we do not get a
solution if the geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold varies from point to
point in Minkowski spacetime - except in the adiabatic approximation.

There are also problems with "unitarity" in string theory when the
geometry of space changes with time. This is already familiar from
ordinary quantum field theory on curved spacetime. In quantum field
theory, people usually like to describe time evolution using unitary
operators on a Hilbert space of states. But this approach breaks down
when the geometry of space changes with time. People have studied this
problem in detail, and there seems to be no completely satisfactory way
to get around it. No way, that is, except the radical step of ceasing to
treat the geometry of spacetime as a fixed "background". In other
words: stop doing quantum field theory on spacetime with a
pre-established metric, and invent a background-free theory of quantum
gravity! But this is not so easy - see ["Week 132"](#week132) for
more on what it would entail.

Apparently this issue is coming to the attention of string theorists now
that they are trying to study their theory on non-static background
metrics, such as anti-de Sitter spacetime. Indeed, someone at the
conference said that a bunch of top string theorists recently got
together to hammer out a strategy for where string theory should go
next, but they got completely stuck due to this problem. I think this is
good: it means string theorists are starting to take the foundational
issues of quantum gravity more seriously. These issues are deep and
difficult.

However, lest I seem to be picking on string theory unduly, I should
immediately add that all the other approaches have equally serious
flaws. For example, loop quantum gravity is wonderfully background-free,
but so far it is almost solely a theory of kinematics, rather than
dynamics. In other words, it provides a description of the geometry of
*space* at the quantum level, but says little about *spacetime*.
Recently people have begun to study dynamics with the help of "spin
foams", but we still can't compute anything well enough to be sure
we're on the right track. So, pessimistically speaking, it's possible
that the background-free quality of loop quantum gravity has only been
achieved by simplifying assumptions that will later prevent us from
understanding dynamics.

Alain Connes expressed this worry during Abhay Ashtekar's talk, as did
Arthur Jaffe afterwards. Technically speaking, the main issue is that
loop quantum gravity assumes that unsmeared Wilson loops are sensible
observables at the kinematical level, while in other theories, like
Yang-Mills theory, one always needs to smear the Wilson loops. Of course
these other theories aren't background-free, so loop quantum gravity
probably *should* be different. But until we know that loop quantum
gravity really gives gravity (or some fancier theory like supergravity)
in the large-scale limit, we can't be sure it should be different in
this particular way. It's a legitimate worry... but only time will
tell!

I could continue listing approaches and their flaws, including Connes'
own approach using noncommutative geometry, but let me stop here. The
only really good news is that different approaches have *different*
flaws. Thus, by comparing them, one might learn something!

Some more papers have come out recently which delve into the
philosophical aspects of this muddle:

2) Carlo Rovelli, Quantum spacetime: what do we know?, to appear in
Physics Meets Philosophy at the Planck Scale, eds. Craig Callender and
Nick Huggett, Cambridge U. Press. Preprint available as
[gr-qc/9903045](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9903045).

3) J. Butterfield and C. J. Isham, Spacetime and the philosophical
challenge of quantum gravity, to appear in Physics Meets Philosophy at
the Planck Scale, eds. Craig Callender and Nick Huggett, Cambridge U.
Press. Preprint available as
[gr-qc/9903072](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9903072).

Rovelli's paper is a bit sketchy, but it outlines ideas which I find
very appealing - I always find him to be very clear-headed about the
conceptual issues of quantum gravity. I found the latter paper a bit
frustrating, because it lays out a wide variety of possible positions
regarding quantum gravity, but doesn't make a commitment to any one of
them. However, this is probably good when one is writing to an audience
of philosophers: one should explain the problems instead of trying to
sell them on a particular claimed solution, because the proposed
solutions come and go rather rapidly, while the problems remain. Let me
quote the abstract:

Now let me mention a few more technical papers that have come out in the
last few months:

4) John Baez and John Barrett, The quantum tetrahedron in 3 and 4
dimensions, preprint available as
[gr-qc/9903060](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/gr-qc/9903060).

The idea here is to form a classical phase whose points represent
geometries of a tetrahedron in 3 or 4 dimensions, and then apply
geometric quantization to obtain a Hilbert space of states. These
Hilbert spaces play an important role in spin foam models of quantum
gravity. The main goal of the paper is to explain why the quantum
tetrahedron has fewer degrees of freedom in 4 dimensions than in 3
dimensions. Let me quote from the introduction:

Naively one would expect the quantum tetrahedron to have the same number
of degrees of freedom in 3 and 4 dimensions (since one is considering
tetrahedra mod rotations). However, quantum mechanics is funny about
these things! For example, the Hilbert space of two spin-1/2 particles
whose angular momenta point in opposite directions is smaller than the
Hilbert space of a single spin-1/2 particle, even though classically you
might think both systems have the same number of degrees of freedom. In
fact a very similar thing happens for the quantum tetrahedron in 3 and 4
dimensions.

horizons: the classical phase space, preprint available as
[gr-qc/9905089](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9905089).

This paper explains in more detail the classical aspects of the
calculation of the entropy of a black hole in loop quantum gravity (see
["Week 112"](#week112) for a description of this calculation). Let
me quote the abstract:

The following are some review articles on spin networks, spin foams and
the like:

[gr-qc/9905087](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9905087).

By the way, Barrett and Crane have come out with a paper sketching a
spin foam model for Lorentzian (as opposed to Riemannian) quantum
gravity:

10) John Barrett and Louis Crane, A Lorentzian signature model for
quantum general relativity, preprint available as
[gr-qc/9904025](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9904025).

However, this model is so far purely formal, because it involves
infinite sums that probably diverge. We need to keep working on this!
Now that I'm getting a bit of free time, I want to tackle this issue.
Meanwhile, Iwasaki has come out with an alternative spin foam model of
Riemannian quantum gravity:

11) Junichi Iwasaki, A surface theoretic model of quantum gravity,
preprint available as
[gr-qc/9903112](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9903112).

Alas, I don't really understand this model yet. Finally, to wrap things
up, something completely different:

12) Richard E. Borcherds, Quantum vertex algebras, preprint available
as [math.QA/9903038](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.QA/9903038).

I like how the abstract of this paper starts: "The purpose of this
paper is to make the theory of vertex algebras trivial". Good! Trivial
is not bad, it's good. Anything one understands is automatically
trivial.
