# March 7, 1999 {#week131}

I've been thinking more about neutrinos and their significance for
grand unified theories. The term "grand unified theory" sounds rather
pompous, but in its technical meaning it refers to something with
limited goals: a quantum field theory that attempts to unify all the
forces *except* gravity. This limitation lets you pretend spacetime is
flat.

The heyday of grand unified theories began in the mid-1970s, shortly
after the triumph of the Standard Model. As you probably know, the
Standard Model is a quantum field theory describing all known particles
and all the known forces except gravity: the electromagnetic, weak and
strong forces. The Standard Model treats the electromagnetic and weak
forces in a unified way --- so one speaks of the "electroweak" force ---
but it treats the strong force seperately.

In 1975, Georgi and Glashow invented a theory which fit all the known
particles of each generation into two irreducible representations of
$\mathrm{SU}(5)$. Their theory had some very nice features: for example, it unified
the strong force with the electroweak force, and it explained why quark
charges come in multiples of $1/3$. It also made some new predictions,
most notably that protons decay with a halflife of something like $10^{29}$
or $10^{30}$ years. Of course, it's slightly inelegant that one needs
*two* irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ to account for all the
particles of each generation. Luckily $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ fits inside $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ in a nice
way, and Georgi used this to concoct a slightly bigger theory where all
15 particles of each generation, AND ONE MORE, fit into a single
irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SO}(10)$. I described the mathematics of all
this in ["Week 119"](#week119), so I won't do so again here.

What's the extra particle? Well, when you look at the math, one obvious
possibility is a right-handed neutrino. As I explained last week, the
existence of a right-handed neutrino would make it easier for neutrinos
to have mass. And this in turn would allow "oscillations" between
neutrinos of different generations --- possibly explaining the mysterious
shortage of electron neutrinos that we see coming from the sun.

This "solar neutrino deficit" had already been seen by 1975, so
everyone got very excited about grand unified theories. The order of the
day was: look for neutrino oscillations and proton decay!

A nice illustration of the mood of the time can be found in a talk
Glashow gave in 1980:

1) Sheldon Lee Glashow, "The new frontier", in _First Workshop on Grand Unification_, eds. Paul H. Frampton, Sheldon L. Glashow and Asim Yildiz, Math Sci Press, Brookline Massachusetts, 1980, pp. 3--8.

I'd like to quote some of his remarks because it's interesting to
reflect on what has happened in the intervening two decades:

Of course we now know how the b (or "bottom") quark decays, we've
seen the t (or "top") quark, we've seen the weak interaction
intermediaries, and we're quite sure there is not a fourth generation
of quarks and leptons. There have been no unanticipated surprises.
Accelerators grew ever more expensive until the U.S. Congress withdrew
funding for the Superconducting Supercollider in 1993. The Higgs is
still waiting to be found or proved nonexistent. Experiments at CERN
should settle that issue by 2003 or so.

Of course, the collapse of the high-energy physics job market and the
death of the Superconducting Supercollider give these words a certain
poignancy. But what is this "passive frontier" Glashow mentions? It
means particle physics that doesn't depend on very high energy particle
accelerators. He lists a number of options:

A) CP phenomenology. The Standard Model is not symmetrical under switching particles and their antiparticles --- called "charge
conjugation", or "C". Nor is it symmetrical under switching left and
right --- called "parity", or "P". It's almost, but not quite,
symmetrical under the combination of both operations, called "CP".
Violation of CP symmetry is evident in the behavior of the neutral kaon.
Glashow suggests looking for CP violation in the form of a nonzero
magnetic dipole moment for the neutron. As far as I know, this has still
not been seen.

B) New kinds of stable matter. Glashow proposes the search for new
stable particles as "an ambitious and risky field of scientific
endeavor". People have looked and haven't found anything.

C) Neutrino masses and neutrino oscilllations. Glashow claims that
"neutrinos should have masses, and should mix". He now appears to be
right. It took almost 20 years for the trickle of experimental results
to become the lively stream we see today, but it happened. He urges
"Let us not miss the next nearby supernova!" Luckily we did not.

D) Astrophysical neutrino physics. In addition to solar neutrinos and
neutrinos from supernovae, there are other interesting connections
between neutrinos and astrophysics. The background radiation from the
big bang should contain neutrinos as well as the easier-to-see photons.
More precisely, there should be about 100 neutrinos of each generation
per cubic centimeter of space, thanks to this effect. These "relic
neutrinos" have not been seen, but that's okay: by now they would be
too low in energy to be easily detected. Glashow notes that if neutrinos
had a nonzero mass, relic neutrinos could contribute substantially to
the total density of the universe. The heaviest generation weighing 30
eV or so might be enough to make the universe eventually recollapse! On
the other hand, for neutrinos to be gravitationally bound to galaxies,
they'd need to be at least 20 eV or so.

E) Magnetic monopoles. Most grand unified theories predict the
existence of magnetic monopoles due to "topological defects" in the
Higgs fields. Glashow urges people to look for these. This has been
done, and they haven't been seen.

F) Proton decay. As Glashow notes, proton decay would be the "king of
the new frontier". Reflecting the optimism of 1980, he notes that "to
some, it is a foregone conclusion that proton decay is about to be seen
by experiments now abuilding". But alas, people looked very hard and
did not find it! This killed the $\mathrm{SU}(5)$ theory. Many people switched to
supersymmetric theories, which are more compatible with very slow proton
decay. But with the continuing lack of new experiments to explain,
enthusiasm for grand unified theories gradually evaporated, and
theoretical particle physics took refuge in the elegant abstractions of
string theory.

But now, 20 years later, interest in grand unified theories seems to be
coming back. We have a rich body of mysterious experimental results
about neutrino oscillations. Somebody should explain them!

On a slightly different note, one of my little side hobbies is to study
the octonions and dream about how they might be useful in physics. One
place they show up is in the $\mathrm{E}_6$ grand unified theory --- the next theory
up from the $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ theory. I said a bit about this in
["Week 119"](#week119), but I just bumped into another paper on it
in the same conference proceedings that Glashow's paper appears is:

2) Feza Gursey, "Symmetry breaking patterns in $\mathrm{E}_6$", in _First Workshop on Grand Unification_, eds. Paul H. Frampton, Sheldon L. Glashow and Asim Yildiz, Math Sci Press, Brookline Massachusetts, 1980, pp. 39--55.

He says something interesting that I want to understand someday --- maybe
someone can explain why it's true. He says that $\mathrm{E}_6$ is a "complex"
group, $\mathrm{E}_7$ is a "pseudoreal" group, and $\mathrm{E}_8$ is a "real" group. This
use of terminology may be nonstandard, but what he means is that $\mathrm{E}_6$
admits complex representations that are not their own conjugates, $\mathrm{E}_7$
admits complex reps that are their own conjugates, and that all complex
reps of $\mathrm{E}_8$ are complexifications of real ones (and hence their own
conjugates). This should have something to do with the symmetry of the
Dynkin diagram of $\mathrm{E}_6$.

Octonions are also prominent in string theory and in the grand unified
theories proposed by my friends Geoffrey Dixon and Tony Smith --- see
["Week 59"](#week59), ["Week 91"](#week91), and
["Week 104"](#week104). I'll probably say more about this
someday....

The reason I'm interested in neutrinos is that I want to learn what
evidence there is for laws of physics going beyond the Standard Model
and general relativity. This is also why I'm trying to learn a bit of
astrophysics. The new hints of evidence for a nonzero cosmological
constant, the missing mass problem, the large-scale structure of the
universe, and even the puzzling $\gamma$-ray bursters --- they're all food for
thought along these lines.

The following book caught my eye since it looked like just what I need ---
an easy tutorial in the latest developments in cosmology:

3) Greg Bothun, _Modern Cosmological Observations and Problems_, Taylor & Francis, London, 1998.

On reading it, some of the remarks about particle physics made me
unhappy. For example, Bothun says "the observed entropy $S$ of the
universe, as measured by the ratio of baryons to photons, is $\sim5\times10^{-10}$." But as Ted Bunn explained to me, the entropy is actually
correlated to the ratio of photons to baryons --- the reciprocal of this
number. Bothun also calls the kinetic energy density of the field
postulated in inflationary cosmology, "essentially an entropy field
that currently drives the uniform expansion and cooling of the
universe". This makes no sense to me. There are also a large number of
typos, the most embarrassing being "virilizing" for "virializing".

But there's a lot of good stuff in this book! The author's specialty
is large-scale structure, and I learned a lot about that. Just to set
the stage, recall that the Milky Way has a disc about 30 kiloparsecs in
diameter and contains roughly 100 or 200 billion stars. But our galaxy
is one of a cluster of about 20 galaxies, called the Local Group. In
addition to our galaxy and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds which
orbit it, this contains the Andromeda Galaxy (also known as M31),
another spiral galaxy called M33, and a bunch of dwarf irregular
galaxies. The Local Group is about a megaparsec in radius.

This is typical. Galaxies often lie in clusters which are a few
megaparsecs in radius, containing from a handful to hundreds of big
galaxies. Some famous nearby clusters include the Virgo cluster (about
20 megaparsecs away) and the Coma cluster (about 120 megaparsecs away).
Thousands of clusters have been cataloged by Abell and collaborators.

And then there are superclusters, each typically containing 3--10
clusters in an elongated "filament" about 50 megaparsecs in diameter.
I don't mean to make this sound more neat than it actually is, because
nobody is very sure about intergalactic distances, and the structures
themselves are rather messy. But there are various discernible patterns.
For example, superclusters tend to occur at the edges of larger roundish
"voids" which have few galaxies in them. These voids are very large,
about 100 or 200 megaparsecs across. In general, galaxies tend to be
falling into denser regions and moving away from the voids. For example,
the Milky Way is falling towards the center of the Local Supercluster at
about 300 kilometers per second, and the Local Supercluster is also
falling towards the next nearest one --- the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster
--- at about 300 kilometers per second.

Now, if the big bang theory is right, all this stuff was once very
small, and the universe was much more homogeneous. Obviously gravity
tends to amplify inhomogeneities. The problem is to understand in a
quantitative way how these inhomogeneities formed as the universe grew.

Here are a couple of other books that I'm finding useful --- they're a
bit more mathematical than Bothun's. I'm trying to stick to new books
because this subject is evolving so rapidly:

4) Jayant V. Narlikar, _Introduction to Cosmology_, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 1993.

5) Peter Coles and Francesco Lucchin, _Cosmology: The Origin and Evolution of Cosmic Structure_, Wiley, New York, 1995.

While I was looking around, I also bumped into the following book on
black holes:

6) Sandip K. Chakrabarti, ed., "Observational Evidence for Black Holes in the Universe", Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1998.

It mentioned some objects I'd never heard of before. I want to tell you
about them, just because they're so cool!

- _X-ray novae_: First, what's a nova? Well, remember that a white dwarf is
    a small, dense, mostly burnt-out star. When one member of a binary star
    is a white dwarf, and the other dumps some of its gas on this white
    dwarf, the gas can undergo fusion and emit a huge burst of energy --- as
    much as 10,000 times what the sun emits in a year. To astronomers it may
    look like a new star is suddenly born --- hence the term "nova". But not
    all novae emit mostly visible light --- some emit X-rays or even $\gamma$-rays. A
    "X-ray nova" is an X-ray source that suddenly appears in a few days
    and then gradually fades away in a year or less. Many of these are
    probably neutron stars rather than white dwarfs. But a bunch are
    probably black holes!

- _Blazars_: A "blazar" is a galactic nucleus that's shooting out a jet
    of hot plasma almost directly towards us, exhibiting rapid variations in
    power. Like quasars and other active galactic nuclei, these are probably
    black holes sucking in stars and other stuff and forming big accretion
    disks that shoot out jets of plasma from both poles.

- _Mega masers_: A laser is a source of coherent light caused by stimulated
    emission --- a very quantum-mechanical gadget. A maser is the same sort of
    thing but with microwaves. In fact, masers were invented before lasers ---
    they are easier to make because the wavelength is longer. In galaxies,
    clouds of water vapor, hydroxyl, silicon monoxide, methanol and other
    molecules can form enormous natural masers. In our galaxy the most
    powerful such maser is W49N, which has a power equal to that of the Sun.
    But recently, still more powerful masers have been bound in other
    galaxies, usually associated with active galactic nuclei. These are
    called "mega masers" and they are probably powered by black holes. The
    first mega maser was discovered in 1982; it is a hydroxyl ion maser in
    the galaxy IC4553, with a luminosity about 1000 times that of our sun.
    Subsequently people have found a bunch of water mega masers. The most
    powerful so far is in TXFS2226-184 --- it has a luminosity of about 6100
    times that of the Sun!

Addendum: Here is something from Allen Knutson in response to my remark
that $\mathrm{E}_6$ has complex representations that aren't their own conjugates. I
hoped that this is related to the symmetry of the Dynkin diagram of $\mathrm{E}_6$,
and Allen replied:
