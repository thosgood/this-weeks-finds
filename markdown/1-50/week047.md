# Week 47 (1995-01-17)

Hi. I know I'm supposed to be taking a break from "This Week's
Finds," but it's a habit that's hard to quit. I just want to briefly
mention a couple of new electronic venues for mathematics and physics.
First, there are a couple new preprint servers along the lines of
`hep-th`:

- Nuclear Experiment (`nucl-ex@xxx.lanl.gov`), started 12/94 
- Quantum Physics (`quant-ph@xxx.lanl.gov`), started 12/94 

To check these out, send email with subject header "help" and no
message body to the address listed, or use more slick modern method.

There are also a bunch of math preprint servers I have been neglecting
to mention. The newest one is devoted to "quantum algebra" (quantum
groups and the like) and knot theory! Here are some:

- Algebraic Geometry (`alg-geom@eprints.math.duke.edu`), started 2/92 
- Functional Analysis (`funct-an@xxx.lanl.gov`), started 4/92
- Differential Geometry and Global Analysis (`dg-ga@msri.org`), started 6/94 
- Automorphic Forms (`auto-fms@msri.org`), started 6/94 
- Complex Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry (`cd-hg@msri.org`), started 6/94 
- Quantum Algebra (Including Knot Theory) (`q-alg@eprints.math.duke.edu`), started 12/94 

Also, there is a new electronic journal on the theory and applications
of category theory. This is a subject dear to my heart since much of the
most interesting work on topological quantum field theories uses
category theory in an interesting way, so I hope mathematicians and
mathematical physicists interested in category theory turn to this
journal:

                   ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS
     
           This is to announce a new refereed electronic journal
     
     
                THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF CATEGORIES
     
     
    The Editors, who are listed below, invite submission of articles 
    for publication in the first volume (1995) of the journal.   
    The Editorial Policy of the journal, basic information about 
    subscribing and some information for authors follows. 
    More details are available from the journal's WWW server at
     
    URL http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/
     
    or by anonymous ftp from
     
    ftp.tac.mta.ca
     
    in the directory pub/tac.
     
     
    EDITORIAL POLICY
     
    The journal Theory and Applications of Categories will disseminate articles 
    that significantly advance the study of categorical algebra or methods, or 
    that make significant new contributions to mathematical science using 
    categorical methods. The scope of the journal includes: all areas of 
    pure category theory, including higher dimensional categories; applications 
    of category theory to algebra, geometry and topology and other areas of 
    mathematics; applications of category theory to computer science, physics 
    and other mathematical sciences; contributions to scientific knowledge 
    that make use of categorical methods.
     
    Articles appearing in the journal have been carefully and critically 
    refereed under the responsibility of members of the Editorial Board.
    Only papers judged to be both significant and excellent are accepted for 
    publication. 
     
    The method of distribution of the journal is via the Internet tools 
    WWW/gopher/ftp. The journal is archived electronically and in printed 
    paper format. 
     
     
     
    SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION
     
    Individual subscribers receive (by e-mail) abstracts of articles 
    as they are published. Full text of published articles is available 
    in .dvi and Postscript format. Details will be e-mailed to new 
    subscribers and are available by WWW/gopher/ftp. To subscribe, 
    send e-mail to tac@mta.ca including a full name and postal address. 
    For institutional subscription, send enquiries to the Managing Editor, 
    Robert Rosebrugh, <rrosebrugh@mta.ca>
     
     
    INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS
     
    The typesetting language of the journal is TeX, and LaTeX is the 
    preferred flavour. TeX source of articles for publication should 
    be submitted by e-mail directly to an appropriate Editor. 
    Please obtain detailed information on submission format and 
    style files by WWW or anonymous ftp from the sites listed above.
    You may also write to tac@mta.ca to receive details by e-mail.
