# March 12, 1995 {#week50}

Your roving mathematical physics reporter is now in Milan, where (when
not busy eating various kinds of cheese) he is discussing BF theory with
his hosts, Paolo Cotta-Ramusino and Maurizio Martellini. This is rather
a long way to go to stumble on the October 1994 issue of the Journal of
Mathematical Physics, but such is life. This issue is a special issue on
"Topology and Physics", a nexus dear to my heart, so let me say a bit
about some of the papers in it.

1) "Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a four-manifold", by Edward Witten, _Jour. Math. Phys._ **35** (1994), 5101--5135.

This paper concerns the relation between supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory and Donaldson theory, discovered by Seiberg and Witten, which not
too long ago hit the front page of various newspapers. (See
["Week 44"](#week44) and ["Week 45"](#week45) for my own
yellow journalism on the subject.) I don't have anything new to say
about this stuff, of which I am quite ignorant. If you are an expert on
$N = 2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, hyper-Kaehler manifolds, cosmic
strings and the renormalization group, the paper should be a piece of
cake. Seriously, he does seem to be making a serious effort to
communicate the ideas in simple terms to us mere mortals, so it's worth
looking at.

2) Louis Crane and Igor Frenkel, "Four-dimensional topological quantum field theory, Hopf categories, and the canonical bases", _Jour. Math. Phys._ **35** (1994), 5136--5154. Also available as [`hep-th/9405183`](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9405183).

I discussed this paper a wee bit in ["Week 38"](#week38). Now you
can actually see the pictures. As we begin to understand $n$-categories
(see ["Week 49"](#week49)) our concept of symmetry gets deeper and
deeper. This isn't surprising. When all we knew about was 0-categories
--- that is, sets! --- our concept of symmetry revolved around the notion of
a "group". This is a set $G$ where you can multiply elements in an
associative way, with an identity element 1 such that
$$1g = g1 = g$$
for all elements $g$ of $G$, and where every element $g$ has an inverse $g^{-1}$
with
$$gg^{-1} = g{^-1}g = 1.$$
For example, the group of rotations in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.
When we started understanding $1$-categories --- that is, categories! --- the
real idea behind groups and symmetry could be more clearly expressed.
Sets have elements, and they are either equal or not --- no two ways about
it. Categories have "objects", and even though two objects aren't
equal, they can still be "isomorphic". An object can be isomorphic to
itself in lots of different ways: these are its symmetries, and the
symmetries form a group. But this is really just the tip of a still
mysterious iceberg.

For example, in a $2$-category, even though two objects aren't equal, or
even isomorphic, they can be "equivalent", or maybe I should say
"2-equivalent". This is a still more general notion of "sameness". I
won't try to define it just now, but I'll just note that it arises
from the fact that in a $2$-category one can ask whether two morphisms are
isomorphic! (For people who followed ["Week 49"](#week49) and know
some category theory, let me note that the standard notion of
equivalence of categories is a good example of this "equivalence"
business.)

As we climb up the $n$-categorical ladder, this keeps going. We get ever
more subtle refinements on the notion of "sameness", hence ever
subtler notions of symmetry. It's all rather mind-boggling at first,
but not really very hard once you get the hang of it, and since there's
lots of evidence that $n$-dimensional topological quantum field theories
are related to $n$-categories, I think these subtler notions of symmetry
are going to be quite interesting for physics.

And now, to wax technical for a bit (skip this paragraph if the last one
made you dizzy), it's beginning to seem that the symmetry groups
physicists know and love have glorious reincarnations, or avatars if one
prefers, at these higher $n$-categorical levels. Take your favorite group
--- mine is $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, which describes 3d rotational symmetry hence angular
momentum in quantum mechanics. It's category of representations isn't
just any old category, its a symmetric monoidal category! See the chart
in ["Week 49"](#week49) if you forget what this is. Now, there are
more general things than groups whose categories of representations are
symmetric monoidal categories --- for example, cocommutative Hopf
algebras. And there are other kinds of Hopf algebras ---
 "quasitriangular" ones, often known as "quantum groups" --- whose
categories of representations are *braided* monoidal categories. The
cool thing is that $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ has an avatar called "quantum $\mathrm{SU}(2)$" which is
one of these quantum groups. Again, eyeball the chart in
["Week 49"](#week49). Symmetric monoidal categories are a special
kind of $4$-categories, which is why they show up so much in 4d physics,
while braided monoidal categories are a special kind of $3$-categories,
which is why they (and quantum groups) show up in 3d physics. For
example, quantum $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ shows up in the study of 3d quantum gravity (see
["Week 16"](#week16)). Now the even cooler thing is that while a
quaistriangular Hopf algebra is a set with a bunch of operations, there
is a souped-up gadget, a "quasitriangular Hopf category", which is a
*category* with an analogous bunch of operations, and these have a
*category* of representations, but not just any old $2$-category, but in
fact a *braided monoidal $2$-category*. If you again eyeball the chart,
you'll see this is a special kind of $4$-category, so it should be
related to 4d topology and --- this is the big hope --- 4d physics. Now the
*really* cool thing, which is what Crane and Frenkel show here, is that
$\mathrm{SU}(2)$ has yet another avatar which is one of these quasitriangular Hopf
categories.

Regardless of whether it has anything to do with physics, this business
about how symmetry groups have avatars living on all sorts of rungs of
the $n$-categorical ladder is such beautiful math that I'm sure it's
trying to tell us something. Right now I'm trying to figure out just
what.

I'd need to look at this a few more times before I could say anything
intelligent about it, but it looks to be a very exciting way of
understanding what the heck is really going on as far as Vassiliev
invariants, Feynman diagrams in Chern-Simons theory, and so on are
concerned --- especially if you wanted to generalize it all to higher
dimensions.

Alas, I'm getting worn out, so let me simply *list* a few more papers,
which are every bit as fun as the previous ones... no disrespect
intended... I just have to call it quits soon. As always, it should be
clear that what I write about and what I don't is purely a matter of
whim, caprice, chance, and my own ignorance.
