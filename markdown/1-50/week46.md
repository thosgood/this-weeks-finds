# Week 46

I will be on sabbatical during the first half of 1995. I'll be roaming
hither and thither, and also trying to get some work done on
$n$-categories, quantum gravity and such, so this will be the last "This
Week's Finds" for a while. I have also taken a break from being a
co-moderator of `sci.physics.research`.

So, let me sign off with a roundup of diverse and sundry things! I'm
afraid I'll be pretty terse about describing some of them. First for
some news of general interest, then a little update on Seiberg-Witten
theory, then some neat stuff on TQFTs, $n$-categories, quantum gravity and
all that, and then various other goodies....

1) "The speed of write", by Gary Stix, _Scientific American_, Dec. 1994, 106--111.

    "Goodbye, Gutenberg", by Jacques Leslie, _WiReD_ 2.10, Oct. 1994, available via WWW as <http://www.hotwired.com/Lib/Wired/2.10/departments/electrosphere/ejournals.html>

Among other things, the above articles show that Paul Ginsparg is
starting to get the popular recognition he deserves for starting up
`hep-th`. In case anyone out there doesn't know yet, `hep-th` is the
"high-energy physics - theoretical" preprint archive, which
revolutionized communications within this field by making preprints
easily available world-wide, thus rendering many (but not all) aspects
of traditional journals obsolete. The idea was so good it quickly spread
to other subjects. Within physics it went like this:

- High Energy Physics - Theory (`hep-th`), started 8/91 
- High Energy Physics - Lattice (`hep-lat`), started 2/92 
- High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (`hep-ph`), started 3/92 
- Astrophysics (`astro-ph`), started 4/92 
- Condensed Matter Theory (`cond-mat`), started 4/92 
- General Relativity & Quantum Cosmology (`gr-qc`), started 7/92 
- Nuclear Theory (`nucl-th`), started 10/92 
- Chemical Physics (`chem-ph`), started 3/94 
- High Energy Physics - Experiment (`hep-ex`), started 4/94 
- Accelerator Physics (`acc-phys`), started 11/94 
- Nuclear Experiment (`nucl-ex`), started 11/94 
- Materials Theory (`mtrl-th`), started 11/94 
- Superconductivity (`supr-con`), started 11/94 

Similar archives are sprouting up in mathematics (see below - but also
note the existence of the American Mathematical Society preprint server,
described later in this week's finds).

There are many ways to access these preprint archives, since Ginsparg
has kept up very well with the times - indeed, so much better than I
that I'm afraid to go into any details for fear of making a fool of
myself. The dernier cri, I suppose, is to access the archives using the
World-Wide Web, which is conveniently done by opening the document

    http://xxx.lanl.gov

If this makes no sense to you, my first and very urgent piece of advice
is to learn about the World-Wide Web (WWW), Mosaic, and the like, since
they are wonderful and very simple to use! In the meantime, however, you
can simply send mail to various addresses with subject header

    help

2) "Monopoles and four-manifolds", by Edward Witten, preprint available as [`hep-th/9411102`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9411102).

    "The genus of embedded surfaces in the projective plane", by P. B. Kronheimer and T. S. Mrowka, preprint number `#19941128001`, available from the AMS preprint server under subject 57 in the Mathematical Reviews Subject Classification Scheme.

I don't have anything interesting to say about these papers that
wasn't in "week44" and "week45", but
anyone interested in following the revolution in Donaldson theory
initiated by Seiberg and Witten will have to read them.

Let me say a bit about how the AMS preprint server works. Assuming you
are hip to the WWW, just go to

    http://e-math.ams.org

You will then see a menu, and you can click on "Mathematical
Preprints", and then "AMS Preprint Server", where preprints are
classified by subject. Alternatively, click on "New Items This Month
(all Subjects)".

On a related note, you can also get some AMS stuff using telnet by doing

    telnet e-math.ams.org

and using

    e-math

as login and password. This doesn't seem to get you to the preprints,
though. For gopher fans,

    gopher e-math.ams.org

has roughly similar effects.

3) "Spin networks in quantum gravity", by Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin, to appear.

This paper is closely related to the earlier one in which Rovelli and
Smolin argue that discreteness of area and volume arise naturally in the
loop representation of quantum gravity, and also to my own paper on spin
networks. (See "week43" for more on these, and a brief
intro to spin networks.) Basically, while my paper shows that spin
networks give a kind of basis of states for gauge theories with
arbitrary (compact, connected) gauge group, in this paper Rovelli and
Smolin concentrate on the gauge groups $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ and $SU(2)$, which are
relevant to quantum gravity, and work out a lot of aspects particular to
this case, in more of a physicist's style. This makes spin networks
into a practical computational tool in quantum gravity, used to great
effect in the paper on the discreteness of area and volume.

4) "Recent mathematical developments in quantum general relativity", by Abhay Ashtekar, 14 pages in TeX format available as [`gr-qc/9411055`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9411055) (discussed in "week37").

    "Coherent state transforms for spaces of connections", by Abhay Ashtekar, Jerzy Lewandowski, Donald Marolf, Jose Mourao and Thomas Thiemann, 38 pages in LaTeX format, available as [`gr-qc/9412014`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9412014) (discussed in "week43").

These are two papers on the loop representation of quantum gravity which
I talked about in earlier "finds", and are out now. The former is a
nice review of recent mathematically rigorous work; the latter takes a
tremendous step towards handling the infamous "reality conditions"
problem.

5) "Differential geometry on the space of connections via graphs and projective limits", by Abhay Ashtekar and Jerzy Lewandowski, 54 pages in LaTeX format, available as [`hep-th/9412073`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9412073).

I've spoken quite a bit about doing rigorous functional *integration*
in gauge theory using ideas from the loop representation; this paper
treats functional *derivatives* and other things that are more
differential than integral in nature. This is crucial in quantum gravity
because the main remaining mystery, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation or
Hamiltonian constraint, involves a differential operator on the space of
connections. (For a wee bit more, try "week11" or
"week43", where the Hamiltonian constraint is simply
written as $G_{00} = 0$.)

Let me quote their abstract:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> In a quantum mechanical treatment of gauge theories (including general
relativity), one is led to consider a certain completion, $A$, of the
space of gauge equivalent connections. This space serves as the quantum
configuration space, or, as the space of all Euclidean histories over
which one must integrate in the quantum theory. $A$ is a very large space
and serves as a "universal home" for measures in theories in which
the Wilson loop observables are well-defined. In this paper, $A$ is
considered as the projective limit of a projective family of compact
Hausdorff manifolds, labelled by graphs (which can be regarded as
"floating lattices" in the physics terminology). Using this
characterization, differential geometry is developed through algebraic
methods. In particular, we are able to introduce the following notions
on $A$: differential forms, exterior derivatives, volume forms, vector
fields and Lie brackets between them, divergence of a vector field with
respect to a volume form, Laplacians and associated heat kernels and
heat kernel measures. Thus, although $A$ is very large, it is small enough
to be mathematically interesting and physically useful. A key feature of
this approach is that it does not require a background metric. The
geometrical framework is therefore well-suited for diffeomorphism
invariant theories such as quantum general relativity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6) "Edge states in gravity and black hole physics", by A. P. Balachandran, L. Chandar, Arshad Momen, 22 pages in RevTeX format, available as [`gr-qc/9412019`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9412019).

Ever since it started seeming that black holes have an entropy closely
related to (and often proportional to) the area of their event horizons,
many physicists have sought a better understanding of this entropy. In
many ways, the nicest sort of explanation would say that the entropy was
due to degrees of freedom living on the event horizon. A concrete
calculation along these lines was recently made by Steve Carlip (see
"week41") in the context of 2+1-dimensional gravity.
The mechanism is mathematically very similar to what happens in (a
widely popular theory of) the fractional quantum Hall effect! In both
cases, Chern-Simons theory on a 3d manifold with boundary gives rise to
an interesting field theory on the boundary, or "edge". The above
paper clarifies this, especially for those of us who don't understand
the fractional quantum Hall effect too well. Let me quote:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Abstract: We show in the context of Einstein gravity that the removal of
a spatial region leads to the appearance of an infinite set of
observables and their associated edge states localized at its boundary.
Such a boundary occurs in certain approaches to the physics of black
holes like the one based on the membrane paradigm. The edge states can
contribute to black hole entropy in these models. A "complementarity
principle" is also shown to emerge whereby certain "edge" observables
are accessible only to certain observers. The physical significance of
edge observables and their states is discussed using their similarities
to the corresponding quantities in the quantum Hall effect. The coupling
of the edge states to the bulk gravitational field is demonstrated in
the context of (2+1) dimensional gravity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't resist adding that I have a personal stake in the notion that a
lot of interesting things about quantum gravity will only show up when
we consider it on manifolds with boundary, including the area-entropy
relations. The loop representation of quantum gravity has a lot to do
with knots and links, but on a manifold with boundary it has a lot to do
with *tangles*, which can contain arcs that begin and end at the
boundary. I wrote a paper on this a while back:

7) "Quantum gravity and the algebra of tangles", by John Baez, _Jour. Class. Quantum Grav._ **10** (1993), 673--694.

and I'll be coming out with another in a while, co-authored with Javier
Muniain and Dardo Piriz. The importance of manifolds with boundary for
cutting-and-pasting constructions is also well-known in the theory of
"extended" TQFTs (topological quantum field theories). These cutting
and pasting operations should allow one to describe extended TQFTs in n
dimensions purely algebraically using "higher-dimensional algebra". So
part of the plan here is to understand better the relation between
quantum gravity, TQFTs, and higher-dimensional algebra. Along these
lines, a very interesting new paper has come out:

8) "On algebraic structures implicit in topological quantum field theories", by Louis Crane and David Yetter, 13 pages in LaTeX format, available as [`hep-th/9412025`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9412025), figures available by request.

This makes more precise some of Louis Crane's ideas on
"categorification". Nice TQFTs in 3 dimensions have a lot to do with
Hopf algebras (like quantum groups), or alternatively, their categories
of representations, which are certain braided monoidal categories. In
this paper it's shown that nice TQFTs in 4 dimensions have a lot to do
with Hopf categories, or alternatively, their categories of
representations, which are certain braided monoidal 2-categories.

9) "On the definition of 2-category of 2-knots", by V. M. Kharlamov and V. G. Turaev, preprint.

This preprint, which I obtained through my network of spies, *seems* to
be implicitly claiming that the work of Fischer describing 2d surfaces
in $\mathbb{R}^4$ via on braided monoidal 2-categories (see "week12") is a bit wrong, but they don't come out and
say quite what if anything is really wrong.

10) "Non-involutory Hopf algebras and 3-manifold invariants", by Greg Kuperberg, preprint `#19941128002`, available from the AMS preprint server under subject 57 or 16 in the Mathematical Reviews Subject Classification Scheme.

I noted the existence of a draft of this paper, and related work, in
"week38". Let me quote:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Abstract: We present a definition of an invariant $\#(M,H)$, defined for
every finite-dimensional Hopf algebra (or Hopf superalgebra or Hopf
object) $H$ and for every closed, framed 3-manifold $M$. When $H$ is a
quantized universal envloping algebra, $\#(M,H)$ is closely related to
well-known quantum link invariants such as the HOMFLY polynomial, but it
is not a topological quantum field theory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, now for some miscellaneous interesting things...

11) "If Hamilton had prevailed: quaternions in physics", by J. Lambek, McGill University preprint, Nov. 1994.

Lambek is mainly known for work in category theory, but he has a strong
side-interest in mathematical physics. This paper is, first of all, a
"nostalgic account of how certain key results in modern theoretical
physics (prior to World War II) can be expressed concisely in the
labguage of quaternions, thus suggesting how they might have been
discovered if Hamilton's views had prevailed." But there is a very
interesting new thing, too: a way in which the group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ shows up naturally when considering Dirac's equation a la
quaternions. This group is the gauge group of the Standard Model! Lambek
modestly says that there does not appear to be any significance to this
coincidence... but it *would* be nice, wouldn't it?

12) "The life and times of Emmy Noether; contributions of E. Noether to particle physics", by Nina Byers, 32 pages in RevTeX format, available as [`hep-th/9411110`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9411110).

    "Reminiscences about many pitfalls and some successes of QFT within the last three decades", by B. Schroer, 52 pages, 'shar'-shell-archiv, consisting of 5 files, available as [`hep-th/9410085`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9410085).

    "My encounters - as a physicist - with mathematics, R. Jackiw", 13 pages in LaTeX format, available as [`hep-th/9410151`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9410151).

These are some interesting historical/biographical pieces.

13) "Speedup in quantum computation is associated with attenuation of processing probability", by Karl Svozil, available as [`hep-th/9412046`](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9412046).

The subject of quantum computation has become more lively recently. I
haven't had time to look at this paper, but quoting the abstract:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Quantum coherence allows the computation of an arbitrary number of
distinct computational paths in parallel. Based on quantum parallelism
it has been conjectured that exponential or even larger speedups of
computations are possible. Here it is shown that, although in principle
correct, any speedup is accompanied by an associated attenuation of
detection rates. Thus, on the average, no effective speedup is obtained
relative to classical (nondeterministic) devices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
