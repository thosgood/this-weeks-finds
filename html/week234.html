<P>
Today I'd like to talk about the math of music - including 
torsors, orbifolds, and maybe even Mathieu groups.   But first, 
some movies of the n-body problem:

<P>
1) Cris Moore, The 3-body (and n-body) problem, 
<A HREF =
"http://www.santafe.edu/~moore/gallery.html">http://www.santafe.edu/~moore/gallery.html</A>

<P>
In 1993 Cris Moore discovered solutions of the gravitational n-body
problem where the particles' paths lie in a plane and trace out braids
in spacetime!  I spoke about these in &quot;<A HREF =
"week181.html">week181</A>&quot;.

<P>
More recently, Moore and Michael Nauenberg have found solutions 
with cubic symmetry and vanishing angular momentum, and made
movies of these:

n-body problem, available at <A HREF =

<P>
Next, math and music.

<P>
Some of you have been in this situation.  A stranger at a party 
asks what you do.  You reluctantly admit you're a mathematician, 
expecting one of the standard responses: &quot;Oh!  I hate math!&quot; or 
&quot;Oh!  <A HREF = "math_cliff.jpg">I was pretty good at math 
until</A>....&quot;  

<P>
But instead, after a strained moment they say: &quot;Oh!  Do you play 
an instrument too?  Isn't music really mathematical?&quot;  

<P>
I guess it's like meeting a Martian and asking them if they like 
Arizona: an attempt to humanize something alien and threatening.  
You may not have much in common, but at least you can chat about 
red rocks.

<P>
Of course there <em>is</em> something mathematical about music, and lots
of mathematicians play music.  I rarely think about music in a 
mathematical way.  But I know they have something in common: the 
transcendent beauty of pure form.  

<P>
Indeed, in the Middle Ages, music was part of a &quot;quadrivium&quot; of 
mathematical arts: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. 
These were studied after the &quot;trivium&quot; of grammar, rhetoric and 
logic.  This is why mathematicians scorn a result as &quot;trivial&quot; 
when it's easy to see using straightforward logic.  So when a 
result seems more profound, they should call it &quot;quadrivial&quot;.

<P>
Try saying it sometime: &quot;Cool!  That's quadrivial!&quot;
It might catch on.

<P>
There are also modern applications of math to music theory.  I had 
never heard of &quot;neo-Riemannian theory&quot; until Tom Fiore explained it 
to me while I was visiting Chicago.  Tom is a postdoc who works on 
categorified algebraic theories, double categories and the like -
but he's also into music theory:

<P>

<A HREF = "http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~fiore/1/music.html">http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~fiore/1/music.html</A>

<P>
4) Thomas M. Fiore and Ramon Satyendra, Generalized contextual
groups, Music Theory Online 11 (2005), available at
<A HREF = "http://mto.societymusictheory.org/issues/mto.05.11.3/toc.11.3.html">http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~fiore/1/music.html</A>

<P>
The first of these is a very nice gentle introduction, suitable
both for musicians who don't know group theory and mathematicians
who don't know a triad from a tritone!

<P>
When Tom first mentioned &quot;neo-Riemannian theory&quot;, I thought this
was some bizarre application of differential geometry to music.  
But no - we're not talking about the 19th-century mathematician 
Bernhard Riemann, we're talking about the 19th-century music 
theorist Hugo Riemann!  

<P>
Based on the work on Euler - yes, <em>the</em> Euler - Hugo Riemann 
introduced diagrams called &quot;tone nets&quot; to study the network of 
relations between similar chords.  You can see his original 
setup here:

<P>
5) Joe Monzo, Tonnetz: the tonal lattice invented by Riemann, 
Tonalsoft: the Encyclopedia of Microtonal Music Theory,
<A HREF = "http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/t/tonnetz.aspx">http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/t/tonnetz.aspx</A>

<P>
6) Paul Dysart, Tonnetz: musics, harmony and donuts,
<A HREF = "http://members2.boo.net/~knuth/">http://members2.boo.net/~knuth/</A>

<P>
Apparently Riemann's ideas have caught on in a big way.  Monzo 
says that &quot;use of lattices is endemic on internet tuning lists&quot;, 
as if they were some sort of infectious disease.  

<P>
Dysart seems more gung-ho about it all.  The &quot;donuts&quot; he mentions 
arise when you curl up tone nets by identifying notes that differ  
by an octave.  He has some nice pictures of them!

<P>
In neo-Riemannian theory, people like Lewin and Hyer started 
extending Riemann's ideas by using <em>group theory</em> to systematize 
operations on chords.  The best easy introduction to this is 
Fiore's paper &quot;Music and mathematics&quot;.   Here you can read about 
math lurking in the music of Elvis and the Beatles!  Or, if 
you're more of a highbrow sort, see what he has to say about 
Hindemith and Liszt's &quot;Transcendental Etudes&quot;.  And if you 
like doughnuts and music, you'll love the section where he 
explains how Beethoven's Ninth traces out a systematic path in 
a torus-shaped tone net!  This amazing fact was discovered by
Cohn, Douthett, and Steinbach.  

<P>
(If I weren't so darn honest, I'd add that Liszt wrote the
&quot;Transcendental Etudes&quot; as a sequel to his popular &quot;Algebraic
Etudes&quot;, and explain how Mozart's &quot;eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; 
tours a tone net shaped like a Klein bottle.  But alas....)

<P>
Let me explain a bit about group theory and music - just 
enough to reach something really cool Tom told me.

<P>
If you're a musician, you'll know the notes in an octave go
like this, climbing up:

<P>
C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B

<P>
until you're back to C.  If you're a mathematician, you might
be happier to call these notes

<P>
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

<P>
and say that we're working in the group of integers mod 12, 
otherwise known as Z/12.  Let's be mathematicians today.

<P>
The group Z/12 has been an intrinsic feature of Western music
ever since pianos were built to have &quot;equal temperament&quot; 
tuning, which makes all the notes equally spaced in a certain 
logarithmic sense: each note vibrates at a frequency of 2<sup>1/12</sup>
times the note directly below it.  

<P>
Only 7 of the 12 notes are used in any major or minor key - 
for example, C,D,E,F,G,A,B is C major and A,B,C,D,E,F,G is 
A minor.  So, as long as Western composers stuck to writing 
pieces in a single fixed key, the Z/12 symmetry was &quot;spontaneously 
broken&quot; by their choice of key, only visible in the freedom to 
change keys.  

<P>
But, as composers gradually started changing keys ever more
frequently within a given piece, the inherent Z/12 symmetry 
became more visible.   In the late 1800s this manifested itself
in trend called &quot;chromaticism&quot;.   Roughly speaking, music is 
&quot;chromatic&quot; when it freely uses all 12 notes, but still within 
the context of an - often changing - key.  I guess Wagner and
Richard Strauss are often mentioned as pinnacles of chromaticism.

<P>
Chromaticism then led to full-fledged &quot;twelve-tone music&quot; 
starting with Schoenberg in the early 1900s.  This is music 
that fully exploits the Z/12 symmetry and doesn't seek to 
privilege a certain 7-element subset of notes defining a key.  
People found Schoenberg's music disturbing and dissonant at 
the time, but I find it very beautiful.  

<P>
Now comes the really exciting thing Tom told me: two other 
symmetry groups lurking in music, and a relationship between them.

<P>
First, the transposition-inversion group.  This acts as
permutations of the set Z/12.  It's generated by two 
especially nice permutations.  The first is &quot;transposition&quot;.
This raises each note a step:
 
<P>
x |&rarr; x + 1 

<P>
Musicians would call this a half-step, just like physicists
measure spin in multiples of 1/2, but we're being mathematicians!
The second is &quot;inversion&quot;.  This turns notes upside down:

<P>
x |&rarr; -x

<P>
The relevance of this to music is a bit less obvious: composers
like Bach and Schoenberg used it explicitly, but we'll see it
playing a subtler role, relating major and minor chords.

<P>
The transposition-inversion group has 24 elements.  Mathematicians 
call it the 24-element &quot;dihedral group&quot;, since it consists of the 
symmetries of a regular 12-sided polygon where you're allowed 
to rotate the polygon (transposition) and also flip it over 
(inversion).  I hope you see that this geometrical picture is 
just a way of visualizing the 12 notes.

<P>
So, the transposition-inversion group obviously on the 12-element
set of notes.  But, it also acts on the 24-element set of &quot;triads&quot;!  

<P>
Triads are among the most basic chords in music.  Mathematically 
they are certain 3-element subsets of Z/12.   They come in two 
kinds, major and minor.  There are 12 major triads, namely 

<P>
{0,4,7}   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     C major triad: {C,E,G}

<P>
and everything you can get from this by transposition.  If you 
invert these, you get the 12 minor triads, namely

<P>
{0,-4,-7} = {5,8,0}                   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
   F minor triad: {F,Ab,C}

<P>
and everything you can get from <em>this</em> by transposition.  

<P>
(Note that {0,-4,-7} = {5,8,0} because we're working mod 12
and the order doesn't matter.  I've also included the way musicians
talk about these triads, in case you care.)

<P>
Major triads sound happy; when you invert them they sound sad, 
just like an upside-down smile looks sad.  There could be some
profound truth lurking here.  A smile has a positive second 
derivative:

<PRE>
.          .
 .        .
    .  .
</PRE>
which says that things are &quot;looking up&quot;, while a frown has negative 
second derivative:

<PRE>
    .  .
 .        .
.          .
</PRE>
which says that things are &quot;looking down&quot;.  An upside-down smile
is a frown.  

<P>
(On the other hand, a backwards smile is still a smile, and a 
backwards frown is still a frown.  So, if you're a company and 
the second derivative of your profits is positive, you can say 
business is looking up - and you could still say this if time 
were reversed!)

<P>
But never mind.  We had this transposition-inversion group acting 
on our set of notes, namely Z/12.  Since tranposition and inversion
act on notes, they also act on triads.  For example, transposition 
does this:

<P>
{0,4,7} |&rarr; {1,5,8}               
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
 C major triad |&rarr; C# major triad

<P>
while inversion does this:

<P>
{0,4,7} |&rarr; {5,8,0}  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
              C major triad |&rarr; F minor triad

<P>
So, we've got this 24-element transposition-inversion group 
acting on the 24-element set of triads!   

<P>
But here's really cool part: there's <em>another</em> important 
24-element group acting on the same set!  It's easy to define 
mathematically, but it also has a musical meaning.

<P>
Mathematically, it's just the &quot;centralizer&quot; of the transposition-
inversion group.   In other words, it consists of all ways of
permuting triads that <em>commute</em> with transposition and inversion!

<P>
Musically, it's called the &quot;PLR&quot; group, because it's generated
by 3 famous transformations.  

<P>
To describe these transformations, I'll need to talk about the
&quot;bottom&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;top&quot; note of a
triad.  If you know a wee bit of music theory this should be obvious
as long as you know I'm talking about triads in root position.  If
you're a mathematician who has never studied music theory and you
think of triads as 3-element subsets of Z/12, it might be less
obvious, since Z/12 doesn't have a nice ordering - it only has a
<em>cyclic</em> ordering.  But this is enough.  The point is that major
triads are sets of the form

<P>
{n,n+4,n+7}, 

<P>
while minor triads are of the form 

<P>
{n,n+3,n+7}.  

<P>
So, we can call the note n the &quot;bottom&quot;, the note n+3 or n+4
the &quot;middle&quot;, and n+7 the &quot;top&quot;.  Musicians call
them the &quot;root&quot;, &quot;third&quot; and &quot;fifth&quot;,
but let's be simple-minded mathematicians.

<P>
Okay, what are the transformations P, L, and R?  They stand for
&quot;parallel&quot;, &quot;leading tone change&quot;, and
&quot;relative&quot; - but what <em>are</em> they?

<P>
Each of these transformations keeps exactly 2 of the notes 
in our triad the same.  Also, each changes major triads into
minor triads and vice versa.  These features make these 
transformations musically interesting.

<P>
The transformation &quot;P&quot; keeps the top and bottom notes the same.
I've now said enough for you to figure out what it does... 
at least in principle.  For example:

<P>
P: {0,4,7} |&rarr; {0,3,7}         
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
    C major triad |&rarr; C minor triad <br>
P: {0,3,7} |&rarr; {0,4,7}        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
     C minor triad |&rarr; C major triad

<P>
The tranformation &quot;L&quot; turns the middle and top note into the bottom
and middle note when you start with a MAJOR triad.  It turns the 
bottom and middle note into the middle and top note when you start 
with a MINOR triad.  For example:

<P>
L: {0,4,7} |&rarr; {4,7,11}        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
    C major triad |&rarr; E minor triad <br>
L: {0,3,7} |&rarr; {8,0,3}       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      C minor triad |&rarr; G# major triad

<P>
The transformation &quot;R&quot; works the other way around.   It turns the 
middle and top note into the bottom and middle note when you start 
with a MINOR triad.  And it turns the bottom and middle note into 
the middle and top note when you start with a MAJOR triad:

<P>
R: {0,4,7} |&rarr; {9,0,4}          
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;
   C major triad |&rarr; A minor triad <br>
R: {0,3,7} |&rarr; {3,7,10}        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      
    C minor triad |&rarr; D# major triad

<P>
Can you see why the transformations P, L, and R commute with 
transposition and inversion?   It should be easy to see that they 
commute with transposition.  Commuting with inversion means that 
if I switch the words &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; and also the words &quot;major&quot; 
and &quot;minor&quot; in my descriptions above, these transformations don't 
change!

<P>
You should be left wondering why P, L, and R generate the group
of <em>all</em> transformations of triads that commute with transposition
and inversion - and why this group, like the transposition-inversion
group itself, has exactly 24 elements!  

<P>
It turns out some of this has a simple explanation, which has very 
little to do with the details of triads or even the 12-note scale.  
  
<P>
Imagine a scale with n equally spaced notes.   Transpositions
and inversions will generate a group with 2n elements.  Let's 
call this group G.  If you take any &quot;sufficiently generic&quot; chord 
in our scale, G will act on it to give a set S consisting of 2n 
different chords.  Then it's a mathematical fact that the group of 
permutations of S that commute with all transformations in G 
will be isomorphic to G!  So, it too will have 2n elements.

<P>
To explain <em>why</em> this is true, I need a bit more math.

<P>
First of all, I need to define my terms.  I'm defining a chord 
to be &quot;sufficiently generic&quot; if no element of G maps it to itself.  
We then say G acts <em>freely</em> on S.  By the way we've set 
things up, G also acts <em>transitively</em> on S.  A nonempty set on which G 
acts both freely and transitively is called a &quot;G-torsor&quot;.  You can 
read about torsors here:

<P>
7) John Baez, Torsors made easy, 
<A HREF = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/torsors.html">
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/torsors.html</A>

<P>
They're philosophically very interesting, since they're related
to gauge symmetries in physics... but right now the only fact we
need is that any G-torsor is isomorphic to G.  So, we can identify 
S with G, with G acting by left multiplication.  

<P>
Then, it's a well-known fact that any permutation of G that
commutes with left multiplication by all elements of G must be 
given by <em>right</em> multiplication by some element of G.  And
these right multiplications form a group of transformations 
that is isomorphic to G... just as we were trying to show!

<P>
In other words: the group of permutations of G has a subgroup 
isomorphic to G, namely the left translations.  It also has
another subgroup isomorphic to G, namely the right translations.
Each of these subgroups is the &quot;centralizer&quot; of the other.  That
is, each one consists of all permutations that commute with every 
permutation in the other one!   Fiore and Satyendra call them 
&quot;dual groups&quot;.  

<P>
In our application to music, the first copy of G is our good old 
transposition-inversion group, while the second copy is a 
generalization of the PLR group.  Fiore and Satyendra call it the 
&quot;generalized contextual group&quot;.

<P>
All this is indeed very general.  I don't know a similarly 
general explanation of why the operations P, L, and R succeed 
in generating all transformations that commute with transposition 
and inversion.  

<P>
I asked Tom Fiore if he and Ramon Satyendra were the first to 
show that the PRL group was the centralizer of the transposition-
inversion group.  His reply was packed with information, so 
I'll quote it:

<blockquote>
  The initial insight about the duality between the T/I group and 
  the PLR group was at least 20 year ago.  Dual groups in the musical
  sense were introduced in David Lewin's seminal 1987 book &quot;Generalized
  Musical Intervals and Transformation Theory.&quot;  This book stimulated
  interest in neo-Riemannian theory, since Lewin recalled the
  transformations P,L, and R as objects of study.

<P>
  Major-minor duality was a concern of Hugo Riemann, a theorist from
  the second half of the 19th century.  Given his interest in duality,
  Riemann may have had some intuition about a duality between T/I and
  PLR, though it wasn't until after his death that this duality was
  formulated in algebraic terms.  An algebraic proof of the duality of
  T/I and PLR was in the thesis of Julian Hook in 2002.
   
<P>
  Ramon and I were the first to prove that the &quot;generalized contextual 
  group&quot; is dual to the T/I group acting on a set generated by an 
  arbitrary pitch-class segment satisfying the tritone condition.  
  (The tritone condition says that the inital pitch-class segment 
  contains an interval other than a tritone and unison.)  Our 
  theorem has the PLR group and major/minor triads as a special case,
  since the generalized contextual group becomes the PLR group when one
  takes the generating pitch class segment to be the three pitches of a
  major chord.  The advantage of our generalization is that one can now
  apply the PLR insight to passages that are not triadic.  There was a
  general move toward this in practice for the past decade (Childs and
  Gollin considered seventh chords rather than triads, Lewin analyzed
  instances of a non-diatonic phrase in a piano work of Schoenberg, we
  analyzed Hindemith, and so on).  Most music does not consist entirely
  of triads (e.g. late 19th century chromatic music), so the restriction
  of PLR to triads was not conclusive.
   
<P>
  We did a literature review of recent neo-Riemannian theory in Part 
  5 of our article &quot;Generalized Contextual Groups&quot;, since there have 
  been a lot of insights in the past 10 years.  One of the main
  thinkers is Rick Cohn, who came up with (among other things) a 
  nice tiling of the plane which one navigates using P,L, and R 
  (Richard Cohn, Neo-Riemannian operations, parsimonious trichords, 
  and their Tonnetz representations, Journal of Music Theory, 1997).  
  It is quite geometric.

In fact, the notion of &quot;torsor&quot; pervades the work of David
Lewin, but not under this name - Lewin calls it a &quot;general

torsors in 2005:

think it's available online.  Luckily, the music theorists have 
set up some free online journals, like this:

<P>
Now let me turn up the math level a notch....

<P>
If you're the right sort of mathematician, you'll have noticed by
now that we're doing some fun stuff starting with the abelian
group A = Z/12.   First we're forming the group G consisting of all
&quot;affine transformations&quot; of A.  These are the transformations that 
preserve all these operations:

<P>
(x,y) |&rarr; cx + (1-c)y                

<P>
where c is an integer.   For A = Z/n, the group of affine
transformations has the transposition-inversion group as a
subgroup.  The whole affine group has 48 elements, but for 
now we only keep this subgroup with 24 elements.  Call it G.


<P>
Then, we're saying that we can take any &quot;sufficiently generic&quot; 
subset of A, hit it with all elements of G, and get a G-torsor, 
say S.  G is then seen as a subgroup of the group of permutations 
of S, and the centralizer of this subgroup is again isomorphic to 
G.

<P>
You may be more familiar with affine transformations on a vector 
space, where we get to use any real number for c.   Then 

<P>
cx + (1-c)y       

<P>
describes the line through x and y, so you can say that affine 
transformations are those that preserve lines.  Vector spaces are 
R-modules for R the reals, while abelian groups are R-modules for 
R the integers.  The concept of &quot;affine transformations&quot; of an 
R-module works pretty much the same way whenever R is any 
commutative ring.   And, indeed, everything I just said in the last
paragraph works if we let A be an R-module for any commutative ring 
R.   

<P>
So, there's some very simple nice abstract stuff going on here:
we're taking an abelian group A, looking at a subgroup G of its
affine transformations, and seeing that sufficiently generic
subsets of A give rise to G-torsors!

<P>
These are nice examples of G-torsors, since nobody is likely to 
accidentally confuse them with the group G.  If you read my webpage
on torsors, you'll see it's often easy to mix up a G-torsor with 
the group G itself.

<P>
In fact, I just committed this sin myself!   The set of notes is 
not naturally an abelian group until we pick an origin - a place 
for the chromatic scale to start.  It's really just an A-torsor, 
where A is the abelian group generated by transposition.  

<P>
So, there lots of torsors lurking in music....

<P>
The pretty math I've just described only captures a microscopic 
portion of what makes music interesting.  It doesn't, for example,
have anything to say about what makes some intervals more dissonant
than others.  As Pythagoras noticed, simple frequency ratios like 
3/2 or 4/3 make for less dissonant chords than gnarly fractions 
like 1259/723.  The equal tempered tuning system, where the basic
frequency ratio is 2<sup>1/12</sup>, would have made Pythagoras roll in 
his grave!   Advocates of other tuning systems say these irrational 
frequency ratios are driving us crazy, making wars break out and 
plants wilt - but there's an unavoidable conflict between the desire 
for simple ratios and the desire for evenly spaced notes, built into 
the fabric of mathematics and music.  Every tuning system is thus a
compromise.  I would like to understand this better; there's bound 
to be a lot of nice number theory here.

<P>
To study different tuning systems in a unified way, one first step
is replace the group Z/12 by a continuous circle.  Points on this
circle are &quot;frequencies modulo octaves&quot;, since for many - though 
certainly not all - purposes it's good to consider two notes 
&quot;the same&quot; if they differ by an octave.  Mathematically this circle 
is R<sup>+</sup>/2, namely the multiplicative group of positive real numbers 
modulo doubling.  As a group, it's isomorphic to the usual circle
group, U(1). 

<P>
This &quot;pitch class circle&quot; plays a major role in the work of Dmitri 
Tymoczko, a composer and music theorist from Princeton, who emailed 
me after I left a grumpy comment on the discussion page for this 
fascinating but slightly obscure article:

He's recently been working on voice leading and orbifolds.  They're 
related topics, because if you have a choir of n indistinguishable 
angels, each singing a note, the set of possibilities is:

<P>
T<sup>n</sup>/S<sub>n</sub>

<P>
where T<sup>n</sup> is the n-torus - the product of n copies of the
pitch class circle - and S<sub>n</sub> is the permutation group,
acting on n-tuples of notes in the obvious way.  This quotient is not
usually a manifold, because it has singularities at certain points
where more than one voice sings the same note.  But, it's an
<em>orbifold</em>.  This kind of slightly singular quotient space is
precisely what orbifolds were invented to deal with.

<P>
Tymoczko is coming out with an article about this in Science 
magazine.  For now, you can learn more about the geometry of 
music by playing with his &quot;ChordGeometries&quot; software:

<P>
As for &quot;voice leading&quot;, let me just quote his explanation, 
suitable for mathematicians, of this musical concept:

<blockquote>
  BTW, if you're writing on neo-Riemannian theory in music, it 
  might be helpful to keep the following basic distinction in 
  mind.  There are chord progressions, which are essentially 
  functions from unordered chords to unordered chords (e.g. the 
  chord progression (function) that takes C major to E minor).

<P>
  Then there are voice leadings, which are mappings from the notes 
  of one chord to the notes of the other E.g. &quot;take the C in a C 
  major triad and move it down by semitone to the B.&quot;  This voice 
  leading can be written: 
<P>
(C, E, G) |&rarr; (B, E, G).

<P>
  This distinction is constantly getting blurred by neo-Riemannian 
  music theorists.  But to really understand &quot;neo-Riemannian 
  chord progressions&quot; you have to be quite clear about it.

<P>
  To form a generalized neo-Riemannian chord progression, start 
  with an ordered pair of chords, say (C major, E minor).  Then 
  apply all the transpositions and inversions to this pairs, 
  producing (D major, F# minor), (C minor, Ab major), etc.  The 
  result is a function that commutes with the isometries of the 
  pitch class circle.  As a result, it identifies pairs of chords 
  that can be linked by exactly similar collections of voice 
  leading motions.

<P>
  For example, I can transform C major to E minor by moving C down 
  by semitone to B.

<P>
  Similarly, I can transform D major to F# minor by moving D down 
  by semitone to C#.

<P>
  Similarly, I can transform C minor to Ab major by moving G up to 
  Ab.

<P>
  This last voice leading, 
<P>
(C, Eb, G) |&rarr; (C, Eb, Ab) 
<P>
is just an inversion (reflection) of the voice leading 
<P>
(C, E, G)| &rarr; (B, E, G).  
<P>
  As a result it moves one note up by semitone, rather than moving
  one note down by semitone.

<P>
  More generally: if you give me <em>any</em> voice leading between C 
  major and E minor, I can give you an exactly analogous voice 
  leading between D major and F# minor, or C minor and Ab major, 
  etc.  So &quot;neo-Riemannian&quot; progressions identify a class of 
  <em>harmonic</em> progressions (functions between unordered collections
  of points on the circle) that are interesting from a <em>voice 
  leading</em> perspective.  (They identify pairs of chord progressions 
  that can be linked by the same voice leadings, to within rotation 
  and reflection.)

<P>
I'd like to conclude tonight's performance with a 
&quot;chromatic fantasy&quot; - some wild ideas that you shouldn't
take too seriously, at least as far as music theory goes.  In this
rousing finale, I'll list some famous subgroups of the permutations of
a 12-element set.  They may not be relevant to music, but I can't
resist mentioning them and hoping somebody dreams up an application.

<P>
So far I've only mentioned two: the cyclic or &quot;transposition&quot; group, 
Z/12, and the dihedral or &quot;transposition/inversion&quot; group with 24 
elements.  These are motivated by thinking of Z/12 as a discrete
analogue of a circle and considering either just its rotations, or 
rotations together with reflections.  But, mathematically, it's
nice to loosen up this rigid geometry and consider <em>projective</em>
transformations of a circle, now viewed as a line together with a 
point at infinity - a &quot;projective line&quot;.

<P>
Indeed, the group Z/11 becomes a field with 11 elements if we multiply
as well as add mod 11.  If we throw in a point at infinity, we get a 
projective line with 12 elements.  It looks just like our circle of 12 
notes.  But now we see that the group PGL(2,Z/11) acts on this projective 
line in a natural way.  This group consists of invertible 2&times;2 matrices 
with entries in Z/11, mod scalars.  People call it PGL(2,11) for short.

<P>
So, PGL(2,11) acts on our 12-element set of notes.  And, it's a 
general fact for any field F that PGL(2,F) acts on the corresponding
projective line in a &quot;triply transitive&quot; way.  In other words, given
any ordered triple of distinct points on the projective line, we can 
find a group element that maps it to any <em>other</em> ordered triple of
distinct points.  

<P>
Even better, the action is &quot;sharply&quot; triply transitive, meaning
there's <em>exactly one</em> group element that does the job!  

<P>
This lets us count the elements in PGL(2,11).  Since we can find 
exactly one group element that maps our favorite ordered triple of 
distinct elements to any other, we just need to count such triples,
and there are 

<P>
12 &times; 11 &times; 10 = 1320

<P>
of them - so this is the size of PGL(2,11).

<P>
This may be too much symmetry for music, since this group carries
<em>any</em> three-note chord to any other, not just in the sense of 
chord progressions but in the sense of voice leadings.  Still,
it's cute.

<P>
We might go further and look for a quadruply transitive group of
permutations of our 12-element set of notes - in other words, one
that maps any ordered 4-tuple of distinct notes to any other.

<P>
But if we do, we'll run smack dab into MATHIEU GROUPS!

<P>
Here's an utterly staggering fact about reality.  Apart from the group
of <em>all</em> permutations of an n-element set
and the group of <em>even</em>
permutations of an n-element set, 
there are only FOUR groups of permutations that are k-tuply
transitive for k &gt; 3.  Here they are:

<UL>
<P>
<LI>
The Mathieu group M<sub>11</sub>.  This is a quadruply transitive group 
of permuations of an 11-element set - and sharply so!  It has

<P>
11 &times; 10 &times; 9 &times; 8 = 7920 

<P>
elements.

<P>
<LI>
The Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>.  This is a quintuply transitive group 
of permutations of a 12-element set - and sharply so!  It has 

<P>
12 &times; 11 &times; 10 &times; 9 &times; 8 = 95,040

<P>
elements.  

<P>
<LI>
The Mathieu group M<sub>23</sub>.  This is a quadruply transitive group
of permutations of a 23-element set - but not sharply so.  It has

<P>
23 &times; 22 &times; 21 &times; 20 &times; 48 = 10,200,960

<P>
elements.   As you can see, 48 group elements carry any distinct
ordered 4-tuple to any other. 

<P>
<LI>
The Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub>.  This is a quintuply transitive group
of permutations of a 24-element set - but not sharply so.  It has

<P>
24 &times; 23 &times; 22 &times; 21 &times; 20 &times; 48 = 244,823,040

<P>
elements.   As you can see, 48 group elements carry any distinct
ordered 4-tuple to any other. 
</UL>

<P>
These groups all arise as symmetries of certain discrete geometries
called Steiner systems.  An &quot;S(L,M,N) Steiner system&quot; is a
set of N &quot;points&quot; together with a collection of
&quot;lines&quot;, such that each line contains M points, and <em>any</em>
set of L points lies on a unique line.  The symmetry group of a
Steiner system consists of all permutations of the set of points that
map lines to lines.  It turns out that:

<UL>
<P>
<LI>
There is a unique S(5,6,12) Steiner system, and the Mathieu group
M<sub>12</sub> is its symmetry group.  The stabilizer group of any point 
is isomorphic to M<sub>11</sub>.

<P>
<LI>
There is a unique S(5,8,24) Steiner system, and the Mathieu group
M<sub>24</sub> is its symmetry group.  The stabilizer group of any point 
is isomorphic to M<sub>23</sub>.
</UL>

<P>
So, the group M<sub>12</sub> could be related to music if there were a 
musically interesting way of taking the chromatic scale and choosing 
6-note chords such that any 5 notes lie in a unique chord.  I can't 
imagine such a way - most of these chords would need to be 
wretchedly dissonant.  Another way to put the problem is that such 
a big group of permutations would impose more symmetry on the set
of chords than I can imagine my ears hearing.  It's like those 
grand unified theories that posit symmetries interchanging particles 
that look completely different.   They could be true, but they've 
got their work cut out for them.

<P>
Luckily, the Mathieu groups appear naturally in other contexts - 
wherever the numbers 12 and 24 cast their magic spell over mathematics!  
For example, M<sub>24</sub> is related to the 24-dimensional Leech lattice, 
and M<sub>12</sub> can be nicely described in terms of 12 equal-sized balls 
rolling around the surface of another ball of the same size.  See 
&quot;<A HREF = "week20.html">week20</A>&quot; for more on this - and the book by Conway and Sloane cited 
there for even more.

It would be fun to dream up more relations between incidence geometry
and music theory.  Could Klein's quartic curve play a role?  Remember

"week215.html">week215</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF =
"week219.html">week219</A>&quot; that this 3-holed torus can be nicely
tiled by 24 regular heptagons:

<P> 
<DIV ALIGN = CENTER>
<IMG SRC = Klein168.gif>
</DIV>
<P>

Its orientation-preserving symmetries
form the group PSL(2,7), which consists of all 2x2 matrices with
determinant 1 having entries in Z/7, modulo scalars.  This group has
24 &times; 7 = 168 elements.  Since there are 7 notes in a major or
minor scale, and 24 of these scales, it's hard to resist wanting to
think of each heptagon as a scale!

<P>
Indeed, after I mentioned this idea to Dmitri Tymoczko, he said
that David Lewin and Bob Peck have written about related topics.  

<P>
Alas, the heptagonal tiling of Klein's quartic has a total of 56 
vertices, not a multiple of 12, so there's no great way to think 
of the vertices as notes.  But, it has 84 = 7 &times; 12 edges, so 
maybe the edges are labelled by notes and each note labels 7 edges.

<P>
Unlike some groups I mentioned earlier, PSL(2,7) is not a transitive
subgroup of the permutations of a 12-element set.  And while PSL(2,7) has 
lots of 12-element subgroups, these are not cyclic groups but 
instead copies of A<sub>4</sub>.  These facts put some further limitations 
on any crazy ideas you might try.

<P>
On the bright side, mathematically if not musically, there is a 
fascinating way to embed PSL(2,7) into the Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub>,
which can be described by getting M<sub>24</sub> to act on the
set of 24 heptagons in the Klein quartic:

<P>
He works in the Poincar&eacute; dual picture, where the Klein quartic
is tiled by 56 triangles, but that's no big deal.

<P>
By the way, in &quot;<A HREF = "week79.html">week79</A>&quot; I explained how
PSL(2,F) acts on the projective line over the field F; the same thing
works for PGL(2,F).  I also passed on some interesting facts mentioned
by Bertram Kostant, which relate PSL(2,5), PSL(2,7) and PSL(2,11) to
the symmetry groups of the tetrahedron, cube/octahedron and
dodecahedron/icosahedron.  Kostant put these together to give a nice
description of the buckyball!

Sure there is. You want to choose a number  N  of intervals into
which to divide the octave, so that there are two tones in the scale
that, like  C  and  G,  have frequencies very nearly in a 3:2 ratio.
(This also gives a bonus pair like  G  and the next  C  up, which are
then in a 4:3 ratio.)  But that just means you want  2<sup>n/N</sup>  to be
nearly  3/2, i.e.  n/N  is a good rational approximation to 
log<sub>2</sub>(3/2).
Use continued fractions or Farey sequences as you like. You'll find
that a five-note octave is not a bad choice (roughly giving you just
the black keys on a piano, and roughly corresponding to ancient Oriental
musical sounds) but a 12-note octave is a really good choice. So it's
not just happenstance that we have a firmly-entrenched system of
12-notes-per-octave. I'm sure you've seen this "7 - 12" magic before,
e.g. the circle-of-fifths in music takes you through 7 octaves, or
the simple arithmetic that  2<sup>19</sup> ~ 3<sup>12</sup> 
(i.e. 524288 ~ 531441).
Long ago I programmed an old PC to play a 41-tone scale because the
next continued-fractions approximant calls for such a scale.

<P>
Of course you could argue that music consists of more than just
(musical) fourths and fifths and so the REAL number theory comes about
by choosing numbers of tones which allow lots of sets of notes to
be in (or nearly in) simple Pythagorean harmonies. How, exactly, you
balance the conflicting goals is a matter of personal choice.

What with the musicians in your family and all that, I'm guessing

Classical music was written for a particular key because the keys
sounded different!  Using the tuning above induces a &quot;distance&quot; on the
keys--how in tune they are.  Pieces would use the dissonant tunings of
other keys for effect.  My friend is an organist and piano tuner; he
says that with the logarithmic tuning all keys sound &quot;equally bad.&quot;

But the timbre of the instrument--the harmonics and
overtones--apparently have a great deal to do with whether a
particular chord is consonant or not.  This is a really cool paper
that illustrates how to choose nearly any collection of frequencies as
a scale and then come up with a timbre for which it sounds natural and

The first several tracks play a tune on a typical 12-tone instrument.
Then they change its timbre by adjusting the harmonics.  Now if played
in 12 divisions of a perfect octave (twice the frequency), it sounds
perfectly awful; but if played in 12 divisions of 2.1, it sounds
&quot;right&quot; again.

William Sethares' &quot;Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale&quot; is the best book

not in themselves important: what's important is that the overtones
of two simultaneously-sounding notes match.  Since harmonic tones
have partials that are integer multiples of the fundamental, you get
pure ratios.

<P>
However, for inharmonic tones, such as bell-sounds, the overtones are
not integer multiples of the lowest tone.  Hence, to get the partials
to match you often need to use non-integer ratios.  Sethares' book
comes with a CD demonstrating this.  It has to be heard to be
believed.

It seems that a bunch of the music on Sethares' CD is available online,
as Mike pointed out above.  I find most of his music interesting
but unpleasant, not because of the tuning systems, but because
it lacks soul.  I haven't listened to &quot;Truth on a Bus&quot; yet.

<P>
Rahn makes some interesting comments on David Lewin's book
Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations, which defines a
concept of &quot;generalized interval system&quot;, or GIS.
As far as I can tell without having read the book, a generalized interval
system is a G-torsor for some group G, where quite likely we might wish to
restrict G to be abelian or even cyclic.  Thus, concretely, a
generalized interval system is a set S of &quot;pitch classes&quot;
on which some group G acts, and such that for any two elements s,s' in S
there is a unique g in G with gs = s'.  In this situation we say
g is the &quot;difference in pitch&quot; between s and s'.  

<P>
A subtle feature of G-torsors is that they are isomorphic to G,
but not in a canonical way, because they don't have a god-given
&quot;identity element&quot;.  I explain the importance of this in
my webpage <A HREF = "torsors.html">Torsors made easy</A>.
However, as in physics and mathematics, some people in music
theory seem willing to ignore this subtlety and identity any
G-torsor with G.

<P>
Rahn has the following comments on Lewin's book.  I find
them interesting because it shows music theorists grappling with
ideas like category theory.

<blockquote>
There are some problems in the formal ideas in this book, and extensions 
to them:

<P>
GIS: Oren Kolman has recently shown (Kolman 2003) that every GIS can be 
rewritten as a group, so that all group theory applies directly 
(&quot;transfers&quot;) to GIS. Among other things, this points up a 
possible flaw in the definition of GIS; a more intuitive definition would 
restrict a group of intervals to some cyclic group of one generator 
(my assertion). (See Kolman 2003.)

<P>
<LI> Definitions in Ch 9: There is a problem here which prevents having 
more than one arrow-label between any two nodes. Lewin defines an arrow 
in his node-arrow def (p. 193) as an ordered pair of points, then maps 
ARROW into SGP, so each ordered pair of nodes has exactly one transformation 
in the semigroup that labels the arrow (one arrow).  This probably originates 
in Lewin's work with groups of intervals, which are constrained to work this 
way.  Of course in most groups, such as D<sub>24</sub>, 
you need multiple arrows. 
There are various alternatives which would work for networks with multiple 
arrow(-labels) for a given ordered pair of nodes.  Multiple arrows (or 
labels on an arrow, depending on the definitional system) in digraphs are 
standard, and it is hard to see what is accomplished by not allowing 
more than one relationship between any two nodes in the model.  You 
also need multiple arrows for groups applied to graphs, category theory, etc.

<P>
<LI> 
With this change, a Lewin network is formally a commutative diagram in some
musical category - a directed graph with arrows labeled in a monoid, such 
that the composition of paths in the underlying category is associative and 
so on (definition of category and of commutative diagram.) Lewin says the 
labels are in a semigroup but his definition of node-arrow system makes 
every graph reflexive, providing the identities that augment a semigroup 
to a monoid. <em>So it is possible to use category theory to explore Lewin 
networks, much as GIS turned out to be 
groups: group theory transfers into GIS theory, and category theory 
transfers into Lewin network theory</em>.

the ICMC, Miami, Nov 2 2004, called &quot;Musical Acts&quot;; 
in this talk I expanded into the relation of Lewin nets to the 
fundamental group of a topological space, and to homotopy classes, and

a general music theory. Later in this seminar I'll give a talk about

</PRE>

Lots of interesting points there (though curiously none about
Fourier analysis, which seem to be a natural connection in the context
of mathematical physics).  For now I'll just address Mathieu groups
and the like.  First, though, a trivial etymological point:

<PRE>
  [...] in the Middle Ages, music was part of a "quadrivium" of
  mathematical arts: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.
  These were studied after the "trivium" of grammar, rhetoric and logic.
  This is why mathematicians scorn a result as "trivial" when it's easy
  to see using straightforward logic.  When a result seems more profound,
  they should call it "quadrivial"!

  Try saying it sometime: "Cool!  That's quadrivial!"  It might catch on.
</PRE>

I hope not; while the usual sense "commonplace, ordinary, unimportant"
of "trivial" does come from a Latin word "trivium", it's not the academic
trivium but a fork in the road -- the meeting of "tres viae", three ways.
Apparently it was common for people to make gossip and other trivial
small talk at these three-way crossings.  See for instance
<A HREF = "http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/trivial">http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/trivial</A>, which to its credit
includes also the technical meaning

<blockquote>
  2b : relating to or being the mathematically simplest case;
  specifically : characterized by having all variables equal to zero
  <a trivial solution to a linear equation>
</blockquote>

-- it would surely be too much to ask a general dictionary to mention
identity elements or maps involving an arbitrary group.  To its
<em>dis</em>credit, the same dictionary glosses "trivium" as "crossroads",
which should of course be where at least <em>four</em> ways meet, that is,
a quadrivium!  In fact the www.m-w.com entry for "quadrivium" also
glosses that Latin word as "crossroads"...

<P>
[Given the TWFiMP context, perhaps this is the place to digress further
and suggest that a Feynman diagram is a network of trivialities, in the
original meaning of "3-way meetings" :-)]
<P>

Back to groups and music:

<PRE>
  I'd like to conclude tonight's performance with a "chromatic fantasy" -
  some wild ideas that you shouldn't take too seriously, at least as
  far as music theory goes.  In this rousing finale, I'll list some
  famous subgroups of the permutations of a 12-element set.  They may
  not be relevant to music, but I can't resist mentioning them and
  hoping somebody dreams up an application. [...]

  * The Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>.  This is a quintuply transitive group
  of permutations of a 12-element set - and sharply so! [...]
 
  These groups all arise as symmetries of certain discrete geometries
  called Steiner systems.  An "S(L,M,N) Steiner system" is a set of N
  "points" together with a collection of "lines", such that each line
  contains M points, and <em>any</em> set of L points lies on a unique line.
  The symmetry group of a Steiner system consists of all permutations
  of the set of points that map lines to lines.  It turns out that:
 
  * There is a unique S(5,6,12) Steiner system, and the Mathieu group
  M<sub>12</sub> is its symmetry group.  The stabilizer group of any point 
  is isomorphic to M<sub>11</sub>. [...]
 
  So, the group M<sub>12</sub> could be related to music if there were a
  musically interesting way of taking the chromatic scale and choosing
  6-note chords such that any 5 notes lie in a unique chord.  I can't
  imagine such a way - most of these chords would need to be wretchedly
  dissonant.
</PRE>

This from the man who finds Schoenberg's music so beautiful?...
(Actually not all of Schoenberg's music is 12-tone, and some of it
is not even atonal; perhaps you had heard only his tonal music and/or
early explorations outside tonality such as the Op.19 piano pieces.)

<PRE>
  Another way to put the problem is that such a big group
  of permutations would impose more symmetry on the set of chords than
  I can imagine my ears hearing.
</PRE>

Curiously the real problem here is that M<sub>12</sub>, big as it is,
is <em>missing</em> an important kind of symmetry: a 12-cycle.
While one wouldn't need all the symmetries of the Steiner system
to be evident in the music, it would be nice for any transposition
of any Steiner chord to be again a Steiner chord.  But, since
M<sub>12</sub> is a simple group, it contains only even permutations,
whereas a 12-cycle is odd.  It follows that M<sub>12</sub> does not contain
the triply-transitive group PGL<sub>2</sub>(Z/11Z) -- though it <em>does</em>
contain the index-2 subgroup PSL<sub>2</sub>(Z/11Z), in two different ways
that are switched by an outer automorphism of M<sub>12</sub>!

<P>
While M<sub>12</sub> does not contain any 12-cycles, it does contain
double 6-cycles.  We can choose one of them (doesn't matter which,
because they're all conjugate in M<sub>12</sub>), and then choose an
action of M<sub>12</sub> on Z/12Z that makes our double 6-cycle act by
translation by 2.  This gives a Steiner (5,6,12) system on Z/12Z
that's invariant under all even translations.  Now there are
Binom(12,5)/Binom(6,5) = 132 hexads in the system, in 66 complementary
pairs, and it turns out that none of the hexads is taken to itself or
its complement by a nontrivial element of M<sub>12</sub>.  So, under
the standard identification of Z/12Z with the chromatic pitch classes,
we get 11 six-note chords that, together with their whole-tone
transpositions and complements of whole-tone transpositions (all
different), form a (5,6,12) Steiner system and thus contain every
5-note chord in just one way.

<P>
One problem with this is that our musical training does not prepare us
to distinguish whole-tone transpositions from non-whole-tone
transpositions.  So, let's form a double Steiner system by allowing
arbitrary transpositions.  This ruins most of the M<sub>12</sub> symmetry
(most of which wasn't audible anyway), but gives us symmetry
under the full group of musical transpositions, inversion,
and complements.  It so happens that this group still acts freely,
so we get 11 six-note chords that, together with their
transpositions and complements of transpositions, contain
every 5-note chord in exactly two ways.

<P>
Back in 1991 I figured out what these 11 chords are.
Written as subsets of Z/12Z rather than of {C,C#,D,...},
they are:
<PRE>
   {0,1,2,3,4,6},
   {0,1,2,3,5,7},
   {0,1,2,3,6,7},
   {0,1,2,4,5,8},
   {0,1,3,4,6,9},
   {0,1,3,5,7,9},
   {0,1,2,4,5,9},
   {0,1,2,4,7,8},
   {0,1,2,5,6,8},
   {0,1,2,4,7,9},
   {0,1,3,5,6,8}.
</PRE>
Each five-note chord can be regarded as a link between two
of these chords (not necessarily different ones; for instance,
the two completions of a symmetrical chord such as {0,1,2,3,4}
must be each others inversion, here {0,1,2,3,4,6} and {-2,0,1,2,3,4}).
The resulting graph is here, with some cryptic labeling to indicate
things like whether one of the chords linked by an edge must be inverted
to get a 5-note overlap:

  It would be fun to dream up more relations between incidence geometry
  and music theory.  Could Klein's quartic curve play a role? [...]
  Its orientation-preserving symmetries form the group PSL(2,7), which
  consists of all 2x2 matrices with determinant 1 having entries in Z/7,
  modulo scalars.  This group has 24 x 7 = 168 elements.  Since there are
  7 notes in a major or minor scale, and 24 of these scales, it's hard
  to resist wanting to think of each heptagon as a scale!
 
  Indeed, after I mentioned this idea to Dmitri Tymoczko, he said
  that David Lewin and Bob Peck have written about related topics.
</PRE>

Right.  In fact this group, call it G168, also has
a doubly-transitive action on 7 objects, which includes
a 7-cycle and thus gives a natural way for this group
to act on a 7-note diatonic scale.  David Lewin noted
this possibility in one of his last papers.

<P>
The key (no pun intended) is that this group G168 is also
isomorphic with the invertible 3&times;3 matrices over Z/2Z --
one of those remarkable isomorphisms between small matrix groups.
So, G168 permutes the 2<sup>3</sup>-1 = 7 nonzero vectors in a 3-dimensional
vector space V over Z/2Z.  The existence of a 7-cycle is automatic
because 7 is prime, though it is true in general that for any
finite field k and any positive integer n the group of n&times;n matrices
over k contains elements that cyclically permute the nonzero vectors
of k<sup>n</sup>.  The reason is that k has a degree-n extension k'; any finite
field has cyclic unit group, and multiplication by a generator is
a cyclic permutation of the nonzero elements that acts linearly over k',
so a fortiori over k!

<P>
But back to G168.  This group also permutes the 7 codimension-1
subspaces (planes) of V, each of which contains three nonzero vectors.
Any two distinct nonzero vectors are contained in a unique such plane,
so we get a (2,3,7) Steiner system, a.k.a. projective plane of order 2,
whose group of symmetries is G168.

<P>
If we use a 7-cycle to identify the nonzero vectors of V with
a diatonic scale, then the Steiner system gives us a distinguished
collection of 7 three-note chords, which form a single orbit under
translation (or "diatonic transposition" in music-theory lingo).
It is well-known that these can be chosen to be either {n,n+1,n+3}
or {n,n-1,n-3}.  Using the first one yields the chords
<P>
  {CDF}, {DEG}, {EFA}, {FGB}, {GAC}, {ABD}, {BCE},
<P>
and either this or its inversions is what David Lewin
suggested using.
<PRE>
  Unlike some groups I mentioned earlier, PSL(2,7) is not a subgroup
  of the permutations of a 12-element set.
</PRE>
Not a transitive subgroup, you mean.  Since the group acts on 7 objects,
it can certainly act on 12 while keeping five of them unmoved.
That's basically what we did above, with the five untouched objects
being the "black keys" C#, D#, F#, G#, A#.  Or, use the action on
the 8 points of the projective line over Z/7Z and leave four of the 12
untouched.

I used Noam Elkies' remark to correct my claim that PSL(2,7) isn't a 
subgroup of permutations of a 12-element set.  Interestingly, the triples
(n,n+1,n+3) and (n,n-1,n-3) in Z/7 are also famous as two equivalent 
ways of defining the <A HREF = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node4.html">octonion multiplication tables</A>!
If we call the seven unit imaginary octonions A, B, C, D, E, F, and G,
then we can define octonion multiplication using the chords Elkies
lists by saying that

<P>
CD = F, DE = G, EF = A, FG = B, GA = C, AB = D, BC = E
<P>
along with knowing they anticommute and square to -1.

<P>
Unfortunately, these chords <em>don't</em> seem particularly fundamental
to music!  Alas, if only they were triads....

   In neo-Riemannian theory, people like Lewin and Hyer started

   Here's a question for you, that you might want to know the answer to:
   <em>Historically</em>, why are there twelve notes in the scale? And why are
   seven white and five black?

<P>
   The answer is that one that ties in lots of stuff about continued
   fractions, but goes along these lines:  one is looking at the octave,
   and divides it up by looking at the first n fifths (in our scale
   c,g,d,a,e,b,...) - this divides up the scale.

<P>
   Pythagoras et al. thought that one should try to keep the variety of
   intervals between consecutive notes as small as possible - in the end,
   deciding that the fewer different intervals present the better.  Scales
   generated by fifths that have only two intervals present between
   side-by-side notes are called Pythagorean.  None have just one interval,
   and the first three Pythagorean scales have 5,7, and 12 notes.  12 was
   thought pretty much enough, I'm guessing, and it can have nicely
   embedded into it the two smaller scales (as white and black notes).

Recently I've been gratified to discover that some neo-Riemannian 
theorists have been acknowledging my contribution in their publications: 
e.g., Cohn, Lerdahl and Gollin.

<P>
I wonder what Bernhard Riemann might have thought of this!  My 
understanding of what his namesake Otto did is as follows: Otto 
described two-dimensional tone nets that extended out indefinitely in 
all directions like wallpaper -in this I believe he followed out earlier 
work of Gottfried Weber.  The initial insight of taking the patterns on 
this flat surface and giving them closure by covering a torus with them 
was mine--I'm not aware of any prior precedents.

<P>
BTW, I'm a physics groupie, always starved for laypersons' accounts of 
the latest stuff.  (The collapse of Scientific American as a classy 
journal was a catastrophe for me.)  I've decided to set aside the rest 
of August for reading your diaries.

Thanks and best, <br>

A guiding principle in modern mathematics is this lesson: Whenever you 
have to do with a structure-endowed entity S, try to determine its group 
of automorphisms, the group of those element-wise transformations which 
leave all structural relations undisturbed.  You can expect to gain a 
deep insight into the constitution of S in this way.</em> - Hermann Weyl
