<P>
Here's a puzzle.  Guess the next term of this sequence:

<p>
<div align = "center">
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
</div>

<P>
and then guess the <em>meaning</em> of this sequence!  I'll give away
the answer after telling you about Coleman's videos on quantum
field theory and an amazing result on the homotopy groups of spheres.

<P>
But first... the astronomy picture of the day.

<P>
The Eaton Collection at UC Riverside may be the world's best
library of science fiction: 

<P>
1) The Eaton Collection of Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror 
and Utopian Literature, <a href = "http://eaton-collection.ucr.edu/">http://eaton-collection.ucr.edu/</a>.

<P>
Right now my wife Lisa Raphals is attending a conference there on the
role of Mars in SF, called &quot;Chronicling Mars&quot;.  Gregory Benford, 
Frederik Pohl, Greg Bear, David Brin, Kim Stanley Robinson and 
even Ray Bradbury are all there!  But for some reason I'm staying 
home working on This Week's Finds.  I'd say that shows true devotion - 
or maybe just stupidity.

<P>
Anyway, in honor of the occasion, here's an incredible closeup of a 
crater on Mars' moon Phobos:

<p>
<div align = "center">

<img width = "500" src = "phobos.jpg">
</a>
</div>

<P>
2) Astronomy Picture of the Day, Stickney Crater
<a href = "http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080410.html">http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap080410.html</a>

<P>
It's another great example of how machines in space now deliver many
more thrills per buck than the old-fashioned approach using canned
primates.  This photo was taken by HiRISE, the High Resolution Imaging
Science Experiment - the same satellite that took the stunning photos
of Martian dunes which graced &quot;<a href =
"week262.html">week262</A>&quot;.

<P>
Mars has two moons, Phobos and the even tinier Deimos.  Their names
mean &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;dread&quot; in Greek, since in Greek
mythology they were sons of Mars (really Ares), the god of war.

<P>
Interestingly, Kepler predicted that Mars had two moons before
they were seen.  This sounds impressive, but it was simple 
interpolation, since Earth has 1 moon and Jupiter has 4.  Or at
least Galileo saw 4 - now we know there are a lot more.

<P>
Phobos is only 21 kilometers across, and the big crater you
see here - Stickney Crater - is about 9 kilometers across.
That's almost half the size of the whole moon!  The collision 
that created it must have almost shattered Phobos.

<P>
Phobos is so light - just twice the density of water - that people 
once thought it might be hollow.  This now seems unlikely, though
it's been the premise of a few SF stories.  It's more likely that 
Phobos is a loosely packed pile of carbonaceous chondrites captured 
from the asteroid belt.

<P>
Phobos orbits so close to Mars that it zips around once every
8 hours, faster than Mars itself rotates!  Oddly, in
1726 Jonathan Swift wrote about two moons of Mars in his novel
&quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; - and he guessed that the inner one orbited
Mars every 10 hours.

<P>
Gravitational tidal forces are dragging Phobos down, so in only 10 
million years it'll either crash or - more likely - be shattered by 
tidal forces and form a ring of debris. 

<P>
So, enjoy it while it lasts.

<P>
Anyone who's seriously struggled to master quantum field theory is
likely to have profited from this book:

3) Sidney Coleman, Aspects of Symmetry: Selected Erice Lectures,
Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 1988.

<P>
It's brimming with wisdom and humor.  You should have already
encountered quantum field theory before trying it: what you'll
get are deeper insights.  

<P>
But what if you're just getting started?

<P>
Sidney Coleman, recently deceased, was one of the best quantum field
theorists from the heyday of particle physics.  As a grad student I
took a course on quantum field theory from Eddie Farhi, who said he
based his class on the notes from Coleman's class at Harvard.  So,
I've always been curious about these notes.  Now they're available
online in handwritten form:

<P>
Someone should LaTeX them up!

<P>
Even more fun, you can now see <em>videos</em> of Coleman teaching quantum
field theory:

<P>
This is a younger, hipper Coleman than I'd ever seen: long-haired,
sometimes puffing on a cigarette between sentences.  He begins by
saying &quot;Umm... this is Physics 253, a course in relativistic quantum
mechanics.  My name is Sidney Coleman.  The apparatus you see around 
you is part of a CIA surveillance project.&quot;

<P>
I wish I'd had access to these when I was a kid!

<P>
Now for some miraculous math.  Daniel Moskovich kindly pointed out a
paper that describes all the homotopy groups of the 2-sphere, and 
I want to summarize the main result.

<P>
I explained the idea of homotopy groups back in &quot;<a href =
"week102.html">week102</A>&quot;.  Very roughly, the nth homotopy
group of a space X, usually denoted &pi;<sub>n</sub>(X), is the set of ways you
can map an n-sphere into that space, where we count two ways as the
same if you can continuously deform one to the other.  If a space has
holes, homotopy groups are one way to detect those holes.

<P>
Homotopy groups are notoriously hard to compute - so even for so
humble a space as the 2-sphere, S<sup>2</sup>, there's a sense in which
&quot;nobody knows&quot; all its homotopy groups.  People know the
first 64, though.  Here are a few:

<P>
&pi;<sub>1</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = 0    <BR/>
&pi;<sub>2</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = Z <BR/>
&pi;<sub>3</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = Z <BR/>
&pi;<sub>4</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = Z/2 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>5</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = Z/2 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>6</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = Z/4 &times; Z/3 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>7</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = Z/2 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>8</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = Z/2 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>9</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)  = Z/3 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>10</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) = Z/3 &times; Z/5 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>11</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) = Z/2 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>12</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) = Z/2 &times; Z/2 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>13</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) = Z/2 &times; Z/2 &times; Z/3 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>14</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) = Z/2 &times; Z/2 &times; Z/4 &times; Z/3 &times; Z/7 <BR/>
&pi;<sub>15</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) = Z/2 &times; Z/2 <BR/>
<P>

Apart from the fact that they're all abelian groups, all finite 
except for the first two, it's hard to spot any pattern!  

<P>
In fact there's a majestic symphony of patterns in the homotopy 
groups of spheres, starting from ones that are easy to explain 
and working on up to those that push the frontiers of mathematics,
like elliptic cohomology.  But, many of these patterns are too
complex for present-day mathematics until we use some tricks to
&quot;water down&quot; or simplify the homotopy groups.

<P>
So, what people often do first is take the limit of
&pi;<sub>n+k</sub>(S<sup>n</sup>) as n &rarr; &infin;, getting what's
called the kth &quot;stable&quot; homotopy group of spheres.  It's a
wonderful but well-understood fact that these limits really exist.
But so far, even these are too complicated to understand until we work
&quot;at a prime p&quot;.  This means that we take the kth stable
homotopy group of spheres and see which groups of the form Z/p<sup>n</sup> show
up in it.  For example,

<P>
&pi;<sub>14</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) = Z/2 &times; Z/2 &times; Z/4 &times; Z/3 &times; Z/7

<P>
but if we work &quot;at the prime 2&quot; we just see the Z/2 &times; Z/2 &times; Z/4.

<P>
After all this data processing, we get some astounding pictures:

spheres at the prime 5.  To understand exactly what it means, read this:

<P>
But now, I want to talk about an amazing paper that pursues a
very different line of attack.  It gives a beautiful description 
of <i>all</i> the homotopy groups of S<sup>2</sup>, in terms of braids:

<P>
For this you need to realize that for any n, there's a group B<sub>n</sub>
whose elements are n-strand braids.  For example, here's an element
of B<sub>3</sub>:

<PRE>
|   |  |  
 \ /   | 
  /    |       
 / \   |
|   \ /    
|    /         
|   / \   
 \ /   | 
  /    |      
 / \   |
|   \ /    
|    /        
|   / \   
 \ /   | 
  /    |      
 / \   |
|   \ /    
|    /         
|   / \   
|  |   |
</PRE>

I actually talked about this specific braid back in &quot;<a href =
"week233.html">week233</A>&quot;.  But anyway, we count two braids as
the same if you can wiggle one around until it looks like the other
without moving the ends at the top and bottom - which you can think of
as nailed to the ceiling and floor.

<P>
How do braids become a group?  Easy: we multiply them by putting 
one on top of the other.  For example, this braid:

<PRE>
     |   |   |
      \ /    |
A  =   /     |
      / \    |
     |   |   |
</PRE>
times this one:

<PRE>
     |   |   |   
     |    \ /    
B =  |     /    
     |    / \  
     |   |   |
</PRE>
equals this:

<PRE>
     |   |   |
      \ /    |
       /     |
      / \    |
     |   |   |
AB = |   |   |   
     |    \ /    
     |     /    
     |    / \  
     |   |   |
</PRE>
and in fact the big one I showed you earlier is (AB)<sup>3</sup>.  

<P>
As you let your eye slide from the top to the bottom of a braid, the
strands move around.  We can visualize their motion as a bunch of
points running around the plane, never bumping into each other.  This
gives an interesting way to generalize the concept of a braid!
Instead of points running around the plane, we can have points running
around S<sup>2</sup>, or some other surface X.  So, for any surface
X and any number n of strands, we get a &quot;surface braid
group&quot;, called B<sub>n</sub>(X).

<P>
As I hinted in &quot;<a href = "week261.html">week261</A>&quot;, these
surface braid groups have cool relationships to Dynkin diagrams.  I
urged you to read this paper, and I'll urge you again:

<P>

10) Daniel Allcock, Braid pictures for Artin groups, 
available as <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/math.GT/9907194">arXiv:math.GT/9907194</a>.

<P>
But for now, we just need the &quot;spherical braid group&quot; B<sub>n</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)
together with the usual braid group B<sub>n</sub>.  

<P>
Let's say a braid is &quot;Brunnian&quot; if when you remove any one strand,
the remaining braid becomes the identity: you can straighten out 
all the remaining strands to make them vertical.  It's a fun little
exercise to check that Brunnian braids form a subgroup of all braids.
So, we have an n-strand Brunnian braid group BB<sub>n</sub>.  

<P>
The same idea works for braids on other surface, like the 2-sphere.
So, we also have an n-strand <i>spherical</i> Brunnian braid group
BB<sub>n</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>).

<P>
Now, there's obvious map

<P>
B<sub>n</sub> &rarr; B<sub>n</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)

<P>
Why?  An element of B<sub>n</sub> describes the motion of a bunch of points 
running around the plane, but the plane sits inside the 2-sphere:
the 2-sphere is just the plane with an extra point tacked on.  So,
an ordinary braid gives a spherical braid.

<P>
This map clearly sends Brunnian braids to spherical Brunnian braids, 
so we get a map

<P>
f: BB<sub>n</sub> &rarr; BB<sub>n</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>)

<P>
And now we're ready for the shocking theorem of Berrick, Cohen, 
Wong and Wu:

<P>
<b>Theorem:</b> For n &gt; 3, &pi;<sub>n</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) is
BB<sub>n</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) modulo the image of f.
</blockquote>

<P>
In something more like plain English: when n is big enough, the 
nth homotopy group of the 2-sphere consists of spherical Brunnian
braids modulo ordinary Brunnian braids!

<P>
Zounds!  What do the homotopy groups of S<sup>2</sup> have to do with
braids?  It's not supposed to be obvious!  The proof of this result is
long and deep, making use of flows on metric spaces, and also the fact
that all the Brunnian braid groups BB<sub>n</sub> fit together into a
&quot;simplicial group&quot; whose nth homology is the nth homotopy
group of S<sup>2</sup>.  I'd love to understand all this stuff, but I
don't yet.

<P>
This result doesn't instantly help us &quot;compute&quot; the homotopy
groups of S<sup>2</sup> - at least not in the sense of writing them
down as a product of groups like Z/p<sup>n</sup>.  But, it gives a new view of
these homotopy groups, and there's no telling where this might lead.

<P>
When I was first getting ready to write this article, I was also 
going to tell you about some amazing descriptions of the homotopy 
groups of the <i>3-sphere</i>, due to Wu.  

<P>
However, I later realized - first to my shock, and then my
embarrassment for not having known it already - that the nth homotopy
group of S<sup>3</sup> is <i>the same</i> as the nth homotopy group of
S<sup>2</sup>, at least for n &gt; 2.  Do you see why?

<P>
Given this, it turns out that Wu's results are predecessors of the
theorem just stated, a bit more combinatorial and less &quot;geometric&quot;.
Wu's results appeared here:

<P>
Next I want to talk about puzzle mentioned at the start of this Week's
Finds... but first I should answer the puzzle I just raised.  Why do
the homotopy groups of S<sup>2</sup> match those of S<sup>3</sup>
after a while?  Because of the Hopf fibration!  This is a fiber bundle
with S<sup>3</sup> as total space, S<sup>2</sup> as base space and
S<sup>1</sup> as fiber:

<P>
S<sup>1</sup> &rarr; S<sup>3</sup> &rarr; S<sup>2</sup>

<P>
Like any fiber bundle, it gives a long exact sequence of homotopy
groups as explained in &quot;<a href = "week151.html">week151</A>&quot;:

<P>
... &rarr; &pi;<sub>n</sub>(S<sup>1</sup>) &rarr; &pi;<sub>n</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>) &rarr; &pi;<sub>n</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) &rarr; &pi;<sub>n-1</sub>(S<sup>1</sup>) &rarr; ...

<P>
but the homotopy groups of S<sup>1</sup> vanishes after the first, so we get

<P>
... &rarr; 0 &rarr; &pi;<sub>n</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>) &rarr; &pi;<sub>n</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) &rarr; 0 &rarr; ...

<P>
for n &gt; 2, which says that 

<P>
&pi;<sub>n</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>) &cong; &pi;<sub>n</sub></sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) 

<P>
Okay, now for this mysterious sequence:

<P>
<div align = "center">
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
</div>
<P>

<P>
The next term is obviously 7.  If you guessed anything else, you
were over-analyzing.  So the real question is: why the funny 
&quot;hiccup&quot; at the beginning?  Why the repeated 1?

<P>
You'll find two explanations of this sequence in Sloane's Online
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, but neither of them is the reason
James Dolan and I ran into it.  We were learning about theta functions...

<P>
Say you have a torus.  Then the complex line bundles over it
are classified by an integer called their &quot;first Chern number&quot;.
In some sense, this integer this measures how &quot;twisted&quot; the 
bundle is.  For example, you can put any connection on the bundle,
compute its curvature 2-form, and integrate it over the torus:
up to some constant factor, you'll get the first Chern number.

<P>
A torus is a 2-dimensional manifold, but we can also make it into a
1-dimensional <i>complex</i> manifold, often called an &quot;elliptic
curve&quot;.  In fact we can do this in infinitely many fundamentally
different ways, one for each point in the &quot;moduli space of
elliptic curves&quot;.  I've explained this repeatedly here - try
&quot;<a href = "week125.html">week125</A>&quot; for a good
starting-point - so I won't do so again.  The details don't really
matter here.

<P>
Back to line bundles.  If we pick an elliptic curve, we can 
try to classify the <i>holomorphic</i> complex line bundles over it - 
that is, those where the transition functions are holomorphic 
(or in other words, complex-analytic).  Here the classification 
is subtler.  It turns out you need, not just the first Chern 
number, which is discrete, but another parameter which can vary 
in a <i>continuous</i> way.  

<P>
Interestingly, this other parameter can be thought of as just a point 
on your elliptic curve!  So, an elliptic curve is a
space that classifies holomorphic line bundles over itself -
at least, those with fixed first Chern number.  Curiously
circular, eh?  This is just one of several curiously circular
classification theorems that happen in this game...

<P>
But I'm actually digressing a bit - I'm having trouble 
resisting the temptation to explain everything I've just been 
learning, since it's so simple and beautiful.  Don't
worry - all you need to know is that holomorphic line bundles 
over an elliptic curve are classified by an integer and some
other continuous parameter.  

<P>
The puzzle then arises: how many holomorphic sections do 
these line bundles have?  More precisely: what's the <i>dimension</i>
of the space of holomorphic sections?  

<P>
Before I answer this, I can't resist adding that these holomorphic
sections have a long and illustrious history - they're called
&quot;theta functions&quot;, and you can learn about them here:

<P>
15) Jun-ichi Igusa, Theta Functions, Springer, Berlin, 1972.

<P>
16) David Mumford, Tata Lectures on Theta, 3 volumes, Birkhauser, 
Boston, 1983-1991.

<P>
They're important in geometric quantization, where holomorphic
sections of line bundles describe states of quantum systems, and the
reciprocal of the first Chern number is proportional to Planck's
constant.  In fact, I first ran into theta functions years ago, when
trying to quantize a black hole - see the end of &quot;<a href =
"week112.html">week112</A>&quot; for more details.

<P>
But anyway, here's the answer to the puzzle.  The dimension turns 
out not to depend on the continuous parameter labelling our line 
bundle, but only on its first Chern number.  If that number is 
negative, the dimension is 0.  But if it's 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and so on, 
the dimension goes like this:

<P>
<div align = "center">
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...
</div>

<P>
Now, this sequence is fairly weird, because of the extra &quot;1&quot;
at the beginning.  I hadn't noticed this back when I was quantizing
black holes, because the extra &quot;1&quot; happens for first Chern
number zero, which would correspond to Planck's constant being
<i>infinite</i>.  But now that I'm just thinking about math, it sticks
out like a sore thumb!

<P>
  It's got to be right, since the line bundle
with first Chern number zero is the trivial bundle, its sections are
just functions, and the only holomorphic functions on a compact 
complex manifold are constants - so there's a 1-dimensional space of
them.  But, it's weird.

<P>
Luckily, Jim figured out the explanation for this sequence.  
First of all, we can encode it into a power series:

<PRE>
1 + x + 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x<sup>3</sup> + 4x<sup>4</sup> + ...
</PRE>

which we can rewrite as a rational function:

<PRE>
                                       (1-x<sup>6</sup>)
1 + x + 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x<sup>3</sup> + 4x<sup>4</sup> + ...  =  ------------------
                                  (1-x)(1-x<sup>2</sup>)(1-x<sup>3</sup>)
</PRE>

<P>
Now, the reason for doing this is that we can pick a line bundle of
first Chern number 1, say L, and get a line bundle of any Chern number
n by taking the nth tensor power of L - let's call that
L<sup>&otimes;n</sup>.  We can multiply a section of
L<sup>&otimes;n</sup> and a section of L<sup>&otimes;m</sup> to get a
section of L<sup>&otimes;(n+m)</sup>.  So, all these spaces of sections
we're studying fit together to form a commutative graded ring!  And,
whenever you have a graded ring, it's a good idea to write down a
power series that encodes the dimensions of each grade, just as we've
done above.  This is called a &quot;Poincare series&quot;.

<P>
And, when you have a commutative graded ring with one generator
of degree 1, one generator of degree 2, one generator of degree 3,
one relation of degree 6, and no &quot;relations between relations&quot;
(or &quot;syzygies&quot;), its Poincare series will be

<PRE>
        (1-x<sup>6</sup>)
  ------------------
  (1-x<sup>1</sup>)(1-x<sup>2</sup>)(1-x<sup>3</sup>)
</PRE>
That's how it always works - think about it.  

<P>
So, it's natural to hope that our ring built from holomorphic 
sections of all the line bundles L<sup>&otimes;n</sup> will have one generator
of degree 1, one of degree 2, one of degree 3, and one relation 
of degree 6.

<P>
And, this seems to be true!

<P>
As I mentioned, people usually call these holomorphic sections
&quot;theta functions&quot;.  So, what we're getting is a description of
the ring of theta functions in terms of generators and relations.

<P>
How does it work, exactly?  Well, I must admit I'm not quite sure.
Jim has some ideas, but it seems I need to do something a bit
different to get his story to work for me.  Maybe it goes 
something like this.  We can write any elliptic curve as the 
solutions of this equation:

<P>
y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + Bx + C

<P>
for certain constants B and C that depend on the elliptic curve.
(See &quot;<a href = "week13.html">week13</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href = "week261.html">week261</a>&quot; for details.)  Now, this equation is
not homogeneous in the variables y and x, but we can think of it
as homogeneous in a sneaky sense if we throw in an extra variable
like this:

<P>
y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + Bxz<sup>4</sup> + Cz<sup>6</sup>

<P>
and decree that: 

<P>
y has grade 3<br/>
x has grade 2<br/>
z has grade 1<br/>

<P>
Then all the terms in the equation have grade 6.  So, we're 
getting a commutative graded ring with generators of degree 
1, 2, and 3 and a relation of grade 6.  And, I'm hoping this 
ring consists of algebraic functions on the total space of 
some line bundle L* over our elliptic curve.  z should be a 
function that's linear in the fiber directions, hence a 
section of L.  x should be quadratic in the fiber directions, 
hence a section of L<sup>&otimes;2</sup>.  And y should be cubic, 
hence a section of L<sup>&otimes;3</sup>.  If L has first Chern
number 1, I think we're in business.

<P>
If anybody knows about this stuff, I'd appreciate corrections
or references.

<P>
There's a <i>lot</i> more to say about this business... because it's 
all part of a big story about elliptic curves, theta functions 
and modular forms.  But, I want to quit here for now.

<b>Addenda:</b> I thank David Corfield for pointing out how to get ahold
of Wu's papers free online - and earlier, for telling me Wu's combinatorial
description of &pi;<sub>3</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>).

Martin Ouwehand told me that some of Coleman's lecture notes on quantum 
field theory are available in TeX here:

James Dolan pointed out that this article:

18) Wikipedia, Riemann-Roch theorem, 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann-Roch">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann-Roch</a>

<p>
has some very relevant information on the sequence

<p>
<div align = "center">
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
</div>
<p>

though it's phrased not in terms of "sections of line bundles", but
instead in terms of "divisors" (secretly another way of talking about
the same thing).  Let me quote a portion, just to whet your interest:

<blockquote>

We start with a connected compact Riemann surface of genus g, and a fixed 
point P on it. We may look at functions having a pole only at P. There is an 
increasing sequence of vector spaces: functions with no poles (i.e., constant 
functions), functions allowed at most a simple pole at P, functions allowed at 
most a double pole at P, a triple pole, ... These spaces are all finite 
dimensional. In case g = 0 we can see that the sequence of dimensions starts

<p>
<div align = "center">
    1, 2, 3, ...
</div>

<p>
This can be read off from the theory of partial fractions. Conversely if 
this sequence starts

<p>
<div align = "center">
    1, 2, ...
</div>

then g must be zero (the so-called Riemann sphere).

<p>
In the theory of elliptic functions it is shown that for g = 1 this 
sequence is

<p>
<div align = "center">
    1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... 
</div>
<p>

and this characterises the case g = 1. For g > 2 there is no set initial 
segment; but we can say what the tail of the sequence must be. We can also 
see why g = 2 is somewhat special.

<p>
The reason that the results take the form they do goes back to the 
formulation (Roch's part) of the [Riemann-Roch] theorem: as a difference 
of two such dimensions. When one of those can be set to zero, we get an 
exact formula, which is linear in the genus and the degree (i.e. number of 
degrees of freedom). Already the examples given allow a reconstruction in 
the shape

<p>
<div align = "center">
    dimension - correction = degree - g + 1.
</div>
<p>

For g = 1 the correction is 1 for degree 0; and otherwise 0. The full 
theorem explains the correction as the dimension associated to a 
further, 'complementary' space of functions.
