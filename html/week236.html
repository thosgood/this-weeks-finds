<P>
This week I'd like to catch you up on some papers about 
categorification and quantum mechanics.  

<P>
But first, since it's summer vacation, I'd like to take you on
a little road trip - to infinity.  And then, for fun, a little
detective story about the history of the icosahedron.

<P>
Cantor invented two kinds of infinities: cardinals and ordinals.  
Cardinals are more familiar.  They say how big sets are.  Two sets 
can be put into 1-1 correspondence iff they have the same number of 
elements - where this kind of &quot;number&quot; is a cardinal.  

<P>
But today I want to talk about ordinals.  Ordinals say how big 
&quot;well-ordered&quot; sets are.  A set is well-ordered if it's linearly 
ordered and every nonempty subset has a smallest element.  

<P>
For example, the empty set

<P>
{}

<P>
is well-ordered in a trivial sort of way, and the corresponding 
ordinal is called 

<P>
0.

<P>
Similarly, any set with just one element, like this:

<P>
{0}

<P>
is well-ordered in a trivial sort of way, and the corresponding 
ordinal is called

<P>
1.

<P>
Similarly, any set with two elements, like this:

<P>
{0,1}

<P>
becomes well-ordered as soon as we decree which element is bigger; 
the obvious choice is to say 0 &lt; 1.  The corresponding ordinal is 
called 

<P>
2.  

<P>
Similarly, any set with three elements, like this:

<P>
{0,1,2}

<P>
becomes well-ordered as soon as we linearly order it; the obvious
choice here is to say 0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2.  The corresponding ordinal is called

<P>
3.  

<P>
Perhaps you're getting the pattern - you've probably seen these 
particular ordinals before, maybe sometime in grade school.  
They're called finite ordinals, or &quot;natural numbers&quot;.

<P>
But there's a cute trick they probably didn't teach you then: we can
<em>define</em> each ordinal to <em>be</em> the set of all ordinals
less than it:

<PRE>
0 = {}            (since no ordinal is less than 0) 
1 = {0}           (since only 0 is less than 1)  
2 = {0,1}         (since 0 and 1 are less than 2)
3 = {0,1,2}       (since 0, 1 and 2 are less than 3)
</PRE>
and so on.   It's nice because now each ordinal <em>is</em> a
well-ordered set of the size that ordinal stands for.
And, we can define one ordinal to be &quot;less than or equal&quot; to
another precisely when its a subset of the other.

<P>
Now, what comes after all the finite ordinals?  Well,
the set of all finite ordinals is itself well-ordered:

<P>
{0,1,2,3,...}

<P>
So, there's an ordinal corresponding to this - and it's the first
<em>infinite</em> ordinal.  It's usually called omega (&omega;).
Using the cute trick I mentioned, we can actually define

<P>
&omega; = {0,1,2,3,...}

<P>
Now, what comes after this?  Well, it turns out there's a
well-ordered set

<P>
{0,1,2,3,...,&omega;}

<P>
containing the finite ordinals together with &omega;, with the
obvious notion of &quot;less than&quot;: &omega; is bigger than the rest.  
Corresponding to this set there's an ordinal called

<P>
&omega;+1

<P>
As usual, we can simply define

<P>
&omega;+1 = {0,1,2,3,...,&omega;}

<P>
(At this point you could be confused if you know about cardinals,
so let me throw in a word of reassurance.  The sets &omega; and
&omega;+1 have the same &quot;cardinality&quot;, but they're different as 
ordinals, since you can't find a 1-1 and onto function between 
them that <em>preserves the ordering</em>.  This is easy to see, since
&omega;+1 has a biggest element while &omega; does not.)

<P>
Now, what comes next?  Well, not surprisingly, it's

<P>
&omega;+2 = {0,1,2,3,...,&omega;,&omega;+1}
 
<P>
Then comes 

<P>
&omega;+3, &omega;+4, &omega;+5,...

<P>
and so on.  You get the idea.

<P>
What next?  

<P>
Well, the ordinal after all these is called &omega;+&omega;.  People
often call it &quot;&omega; times 2&quot; or &quot;&omega;2&quot; for
short.  So,

<P>
&omega;2 = {0,1,2,3,...,&omega;,&omega;+1,&omega;+2,&omega;+3,....}

<P>
What next?  Well, then comes 

<P>
&omega;2 + 1, &omega;2 + 2,...

<P>
and so on.  But you probably have the hang of this already, so 
we can skip right ahead to &omega;3.

<P>
In fact, you're probably ready to skip right ahead to &omega;4,
and &omega;5, and so on.

<P>
In fact, I bet now you're ready to skip all the way to &quot;&omega;
times &omega;&quot;, or &omega;<sup>2</sup> for short:

<P>
&omega;<sup>2</sup> = 
{0,1,2...&omega;,&omega;+1,&omega;+2,...,&omega;2,&omega;2+1,&omega;2+2,...}

<P>
It would be fun to have a book with &omega; pages, each page half 
as thick as the previous page.  You can tell a nice long story 
with an &omega;-sized book.  But it would be even more fun to have 
an encyclopedia with &omega; volumes, each being an &omega;-sized book,
each half as thick as the previous volume.  Then you have &omega;<sup>2</sup> 
pages - and it can still fit in one bookshelf!

<P>
<DIV ALIGN = CENTER>
<IMG SRC = "omega_squared.png">
</DIV>

<P>
What comes next?  Well, we have 

<P>
&omega;<sup>2</sup>+1, &omega;<sup>2</sup>+2, ...

<P>
and so on, and after all these come 

<P>
&omega;<sup>2</sup>+&omega;, &omega;<sup>2</sup>+&omega;+1, &omega;<sup>2</sup>+&omega;+2, ...

<P>
and so on - and eventually 

<P>
&omega;<sup>2</sup> + &omega;<sup>2</sup> = &omega;<sup>2</sup> 2

<P>
and then a bunch more, and then

<P>
&omega;<sup>2</sup> 3

<P>
and then a bunch more, and then

<P>
&omega;<sup>2</sup> 4
 
<P>
and then a bunch more, and more, and eventually

<P>
&omega;<sup>2</sup> &omega; = &omega;<sup>3</sup>.

<P>
You can probably imagine a bookcase containing &omega; encyclopedias,
each with &omega; volumes, each with &omega; pages, for a total of
&omega;<sup>3</sup> pages.

<P>
I'm skipping more and more steps to keep you from getting bored. 
I know you have plenty to do and can't spend an <em>infinite</em> amount 
of time reading This Week's Finds, even if the subject is infinity.  

<P>
So, if you don't mind me just mentioning some of the high points,
there are guys like &omega;<sup>4</sup> and &omega;<sup>5</sup> and so
on, and after all these comes

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>.

<P>
And then what?

<P>
Well, then comes &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> + 1, and so on, but I'm sure
that's boring by now.  And then come ordinals like 

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> 2,..., &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> 3, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> 4, ...

<P>
leading up to 

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> &omega; = &omega;<sup>&omega; + 1</sup>

<P>
Then eventually come ordinals like

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> &omega;<sup>2</sup> , ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> &omega;<sup>3</sup>, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> &omega;<sup>4</sup>, ...

<P>
and so on, leading up to:

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> = &omega;<sup>&omega; + &omega;</sup> = &omega;<sup>&omega; 2</sup>

<P>
This actually reminds me of something that happened driving across 
South Dakota one summer with a friend of mine.  We were in college,
so we had the summer off, so we drive across the country.  We drove
across South Dakota all the way from the eastern border to the west
on Interstate 90.  

<P>
This state is huge - about 600 kilometers across, and most of it is 
really flat, so the drive was really boring.  We kept seeing signs 
for a bunch of tourist attractions on the western edge of the state, 
like the Badlands and Mt. Rushmore - a mountain that they carved 
to look like faces of presidents, just to give people some reason to keep
driving.  

<P>
Anyway, I'll tell you the rest of the story later - I see some more 
ordinals coming up:

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;3</sup>,... &omega;<sup>&omega;4</sup>,... &omega;<sup>&omega;5</sup>,...

<P>
We're really whizzing along now just to keep from getting bored - just
like my friend and I did in South Dakota.  You might fondly imagine
that we had fun trading stories and jokes, like they do in road
movies.  But we were driving all the way from Princeton to my friend
Chip's cabin in California.  By the time we got to South Dakota, we
were all out of stories and jokes.

<P>
Hey, look!  It's

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega; &omega;</sup> = &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>2</sup></sup>

<P>
That was cool.  Then comes 

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>3</sup></sup>, ... &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>4</sup></sup>, ... &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>5</sup></sup>, ...

<P>
and so on.  

<P>
Anyway, back to my story.   For the first half of our half of our 
trip across the state, we kept seeing signs for something called 
the South Dakota Tractor Museum.  

<P>
Oh, wait, here's an interesting ordinal - let's slow down and 
take a look:

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup>

<P>
I like that!  Okay, let's keep driving:

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + 1, &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + 2, 

...

<P>
and then

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + &omega;, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + &omega; 2, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + 3, ...
<P>
and then

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + &omega;<sup>3</sup>, ...

<P>
and eventually 

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>

<P>
and eventually

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> + 
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> = 
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> 2

<P>
and then

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> 3, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> 4, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> 5, ...

<P>
and eventually

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup> &omega; = &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> + 1</sup>

<P>
and then 

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> + 2</sup>, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> + 3</sup>, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> + 4</sup>, ...

<P>
This is pretty boring; we're already going infinitely fast,
but we're still just picking up speed, and it'll take a while
before we reach something interesting.

<P>
Anyway, we started getting really curious about this South Dakota 
Tractor Museum - it sounded sort of funny.  It took 250 kilometers 
of driving before we passed it.   We wouldn't normally care about 
a tractor museum, but there was really nothing else to think about 
while we were driving.  The only thing to see were fields of grain, 
and these signs, which kept building up the suspense, saying things
like &quot;ONLY 100 MILES TO THE SOUTH DAKOTA TRACTOR MUSEUM!&quot;

<P>
We're zipping along really fast now:

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup></sup>, ..., &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup></sup></sup>,... , 
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>,...
<P>
What comes after all these?

<P>
At this point we need to stop for gas.  Our notation for ordinals 
runs out at this point!  

<P>
The ordinals don't stop; it's just our notation that gives out.
The set of all ordinals listed up to now - including all the ones 
we zipped past - is a well-ordered set called 

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>

<P>
or &quot;epsilon-nought&quot;.
This has the amazing property that

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> = &omega;<sup>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sup>

<P>
And, it's the smallest ordinal with this property.  

<P>
In fact, all the ordinals smaller than &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> can be drawn as 
trees.  You write them in &quot;Cantor normal form&quot; like this:

<P>
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>+&omega;+1</sup></sup> +
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>+&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup>
+ &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> + &omega; + &omega; + 1 + 1 + 1

<P>
using just + and exponentials and 1 and &omega;, and then you turn
this notation into a picture of a tree.  I'll leave it as a puzzle 
to figure out how.  

<P>
So, the set of (finite, rooted) trees becomes a well-ordered set whose
ordinal is &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>.  Trees are important in
combinatorics and computer science, so &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is not
really so weird after all.

<P>
Another cool thing is that Gentzen proved the consistency of the 
usual axioms for arithmetic - &quot;Peano arithmetic&quot; - with the help
of &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>.  He did this by drawing proofs as trees, and using 
this to give an inductive argument that there's no proof in Peano
arithmetic that 0 = 1.  But, this inductive argument goes beyond 
the simple kind you use to prove facts about all natural numbers.  
It uses induction up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>.

<P>
You can't formalize Gentzen's argument in Peano arithmetic: thanks to
G&ouml;del, this system can't proof itself consistent unless it's
<em>not</em>.  I used to think this made Gentzen's proof pointless,
especially since &quot;induction up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>&quot;
sounded like some sort of insane logician's extrapolation of ordinary
mathematical induction.

<P>
But now I see that induction up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> can be thought of as 
induction on trees, and it seems like an obviously correct principle.
Of course Peano's axioms also seem obviously correct, so I don't know 
that Gentzen's proof makes me <em>more sure</em> Peano arithmetic is 
consistent.  But, it's interesting.

<P>
Induction up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> also lets you prove other stuff you 
can't prove with just Peano arithmetic.  For example, it lets you
prove that every Goodstein sequence eventually reaches zero!

<P>
Huh?

<P>
To write down a Goodstein sequence, you start with any natural
number and write it in &quot;recursive base 2&quot;, like this:

<P>
2<sup>2<sup>2</sup>+1</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup>

<P>
Then you replace all the 2's by 3's:

<P>
3<sup>3<sup>3</sup>+1</sup> + 3<sup>1</sup>

<P>
Then you subtract 1 and write the answer in &quot;recursive base 3&quot;:

<P>
3<sup>3<sup>3</sup>+1</sup> + 1 + 1

<P>
Then you replace all the 3's by 4's, subtract 1 and write the
answer in recursive base 4.  Then you replace all the 4's by
5's, subtract 1 and write the answer in recursive base 5.  And so on.


<P>
You can try some examples using the applet on this site:

<P>
1) National Curve Bank, Goodstein's theorem,
<A HREF = "http://curvebank.calstatela.edu/goodstein/goodstein.htm">http://curvebank.calstatela.edu/goodstein/goodstein.htm</A>

<P>
You'll see that for any starting number bigger than 3, the
Goodstein sequence seems to keep growing forever.  So, it's
shocking to learn that they all eventually go to zero!

<P>
For example, if you start with the number 4, you get this sequence:

<P>
4, 26, 41, 60, 83, 109, 139, 173, 211, 253, 299, 348, ...

<P>
Believe it or not, this goes to zero after about 7 &times; 
10<sup>121210694</sup>
steps!  For a proof, see Kevin Buzzard's calculations in the
Addendum at the bottom of this article.

<P>
In fact, it takes nothing but algebra, careful reasoning and
persistence to work out when any given Goodstein sequence reaches
zero.  But, proving they <em>all</em> eventually reach zero uses induction
up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>.

<P>
How can that be?

<P>
The point is that these numbers in &quot;recursive base n&quot; look a lot
like ordinals in Cantor normal form.  If we translate them into
ordinals by replacing n by &omega;, the ordinals keep getting smaller
at each step, even when the numbers get bigger!

<P>
For example, when we do the translation

<PRE>
2<sup>2<sup>2</sup>+1</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup>       &rarr;    &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>+1</sup> + &omega;<sup>1</sup>
3<sup>3<sup>3</sup>+1</sup> + 1 + 1    &rarr;    &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>+1</sup> + 1 + 1
</PRE>

<P>
we see the ordinal got smaller even though the number got bigger.
Since &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is well-ordered, the ordinals must bottom
out at zero after a finite number of steps - that's what
&quot;induction up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>&quot; tells us.  So, the
numbers must too!

<P>
In short, induction up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> lets us prove all Goodstein
sequences eventually reach zero.  But Kirby and Paris showed
something much deeper: they showed that you <em>need</em> induction
up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> to get the job done.

<P>
And, they noted a big consequence of this fact.  Suppose Peano
arithmetic is consistent.  Then you can't do induction up to 
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>
in this system - since if you could, Gentzen's work would let this
system prove itself consistent, and G&ouml;del's theorem would kick in
and say it's <em>not</em>.  But since you <em>need</em> induction up to 
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>
to prove all Goodstein sequences go to zero, you can't prove this
in Peano arithmetic.


<P>
So, the fact that Goodstein sequences go to zero is obvious 
if you think about it the right way, but it's not provable in 
Peano arithmetic.

<P>
I don't know any results in mathematical physics that use induction up
to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>, but these could be one - after all, trees
show up in the theory of Feynman diagrams.  That would be pretty
interesting.

<P>
There's a lot more to say about this, but I hear what you're asking: 
what comes after &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>?

<P>
Well, duh!  It's

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + 1

<P>
Then comes 

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + 2

<P>
and then eventually we get to

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + &omega;
 
<P>
and then 

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>,..., &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + &omega;<sup>3</sup>,... &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + &omega;<sup>4</sup>,...

<P>
and after a long time

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> = &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> 2

<P>
and then eventually 

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> 

<P>
and then eventually...

<P>
Oh, I see!   You want to know the first <em>really interesting</em> ordinal 
after &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>.  

<P>
Well, this is a matter of taste, but you might be interested in
&epsilon;<sub>1</sub>.  This is the first ordinal after &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>
that satisfies this equation:

<P>
x = &omega;<sup>x</sup>

<P>
How do we actually reach this ordinal?  Well, just as &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>
was the limit of this sequence:


<P>
&omega;, &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>, &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup>, &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup></sup>,...

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>1</sub> is the limit of this:

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + 1, &omega;<sup>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + 1</sup>, 
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + 1</sup></sup>,
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> + 1</sup></sup></sup>,...


<P>
In other words, it's the <em>union</em> of all these well-ordered sets.

<P>
In what sense is &epsilon;<sub>1</sub> the &quot;first really
interesting ordinal&quot; after &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>?  I'm not sure!
Maybe it's the first one that can't be built out of 1, &omega; and
&epsilon;<sub>0</sub> using finitely many additions, multiplications
and exponentiations.  Does anyone out there know?

<P>
Anyway, the next really interesting ordinal I know after 
&epsilon;<sub>1</sub> is &epsilon;<sub>2</sub>.  It's the next solution of 

<P>
x = &omega;<sup>x</sup> 

<P>
and it's defined to be the limit of this sequence:

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>1</sub> + 1, &omega;<sup>&epsilon;<sub>1</sub> + 1</sup>, 
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&epsilon;<sub>1</sub> + 1</sup></sup>,
&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&epsilon;<sub>1</sub> + 1</sup></sup></sup>,...

<P>
Maybe now you get the pattern.  In general, &epsilon;<sub>&alpha;</sub> is the 
&alpha;th solution of 

<P>
x = &omega;<sup>x</sup>

<P>
and we can define this, if we're smart, for any ordinal &alpha;.

<P>
So, we can keep driving on through fields of ever larger ordinals:

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>2</sub>,..., &epsilon;<sub>3</sub>,..., &epsilon;<sub>4</sub>, ...

<P>
and eventually

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>&omega;,</sub>..., &epsilon;<sub>&omega;+1</sub>,..., &epsilon;<sub>&omega;+2</sub>,...

<P>
and eventually

<P>
&epsilon;<sub><sub>&omega;<sup>2</sup></sub></sub>,... , &epsilon;<sub><sub>&omega;<sup>3</sup></sub></sub>,..., &epsilon;<sub><sub>&omega;<sup>4</sup></sub></sub>,...

<P>
and eventually 

<P>
&epsilon;<sub><sub>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sub></sub>,..., &epsilon;<sub><sub>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup></sub></sub>,...

<P>
As you can see, this gets boring after a while - it's suspiciously
similar to the beginning of our trip through the ordinals, with 
them now showing up as subscripts under this &quot;&epsilon;&quot; notation. 
But this is misleading: we're moving much faster now.  I'm skipping 
over much bigger gaps, not bothering to mention all sorts of ordinals 
like

<P>
&epsilon;<sub><sub>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sub></sub> + &epsilon;<sub><sub>&omega; 248</sub></sub> + &omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega; + 17</sup></sup> + 1

<P>
Anyway... so finally we <em>got</em> to this South Dakota Tractor Museum, 
driving pretty darn fast at this point, about 85 miles an hour... and guess 
what?  

<P>
Oh - wait a minute - it's sort of interesting here:

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub>,..., &epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>1</sub></sub>,..., &epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>2</sub></sub>,...

<P>
and now we reach

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&omega;</sub></sub>

<P>
and then 

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sub></sub>,..., 
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&omega;<sup>&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup></sup></sub></sub>,...

<P>
and then as we keep speeding up, we see:

<P>
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub></sub>,...
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub></sub></sub>,...
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub></sub></sub></sub>,...

<P>
So, anyway: by the time we got that tractor museum, we were driving really fast.
And, all we saw as we whizzed by was a bunch of rusty tractors out in 
a field!  It was over in a split second!  It was a real anticlimax - 
just like this little anecdote, in fact.  

<P>
But that's the way it is when you're driving through these ordinals.   
Every ordinal, no matter how large, looks pretty pathetic and small 
compared to the ones ahead - so you keep speeding up, looking for a 
really big one... and when you find one, you see it's part of a new 
pattern, and that gets boring too...

<P>
Anyway, when we reach the limit of this sequence:

<P>

&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>,
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub>,
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub></sub>,
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub></sub></sub>,
&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub></sub></sub></sub>,...



<P>
our notation breaks down, since this is the first solution of

<P>
x = &epsilon;<sub>x</sub>

<P>
We could make up a new name for this ordinal, like &eta;<sub>0</sub>.  

<P>
Then we 
could play the whole game again, defining &eta;<sub>&alpha;</sub> to be the 
&alpha;th solution of

<P>
x = &epsilon;<sub>x</sub>

<P>
sort of like how we defined the epsilons.  This kind of equation, where
something equals some function of itself, is called a &quot;fixed point&quot;
equation.

<P>
But since we'll have to play this game infinitely often, we might 
as well be more systematic about it! 

<P>
As you can see, we keep running into new, qualitatively different
types of ordinals.  First we ran into the powers of &omega;, then we ran
into the epsilons, and now these etas.  It's gonna keep happening!
For each type of ordinal, our notation runs out when we reach the
first &quot;fixed point&quot; - when the xth ordinal of this type is
actually equal to x.

<P>
So, instead of making up infinitely many Greek letters, let's use
&phi;<sub>&gamma;</sub> for the &gamma;th type of ordinal, and
&phi;<sub>&gamma;</sub>(&alpha;) for the &alpha;th ordinal of type
&gamma;.

<P>
We can use the fixed point equation to define
&phi;<sub>&gamma;+1</sub> in terms of &phi;<sub>&gamma;</sub>.  In
other words, we start off by defining

<P>
&phi;<sub>0</sub>(&alpha;) = &omega;<sup>&alpha;</sup>

<P>
and then define

<P>
&phi;<sub>&gamma;+1</sub>(&alpha;)

<P>
to be the &alpha;th solution of

<P>
x = &phi;<sub>&gamma;</sub>(x) 

<P>
We can even define this stuff when &gamma; itself is infinite.
For a more precise definition see the Wikipedia article cited below... 
but I hope you get the rough idea.

<P>
This defines a lot of really big ordinals, called the &quot;Veblen hierarchy&quot;.

<P>
There's a souped-up version of Cantor normal form that can handle
every ordinal that's a finite sum of guys in the Veblen hierarchy: 
you can write them <em>uniquely</em> as finite sums of the form

<P>
&phi;<sub>&gamma;<sub>1</sub></sub>(&alpha;<sub>1</sub>) + ... 
+ &phi;<sub>&gamma;<sub>k</sub></sub>(&alpha;<sub>k</sub>) 

<P>
where each term is less than or equal to the previous one, and each
&alpha;<sub>i</sub> is not a fixed point of &phi;<sub>&gamma;<sub>i</sub></sub>

<P>
But as you might have suspected, not <em>all</em> ordinals can be written 
in this way.  For one thing, every ordinal we've reached so far is
<em>countable</em>: as a set you can put it in one-to-one correspondence 
with the integers.  There are much bigger <em>uncountable</em> ordinals -
at least if you believe you can well-order uncountable sets.  

<P>
But even in the realm of the countable, we're nowhere near done! 

<P>
As I hope you see, the power of the human mind to see a pattern
and formalize it gives the quest for large countable ordinals a 
strange quality.  As soon as we see a systematic way to generate 
a sequence of larger and larger ordinals, we know this sequence 
has a limit that's larger then all of those!  And this opens the 
door to even larger ones....

<P>
So, this whole journey feels a bit like trying to outrace our car's
own shadow - the faster we drive, the faster it chases after us.
But, it's interesting to hear what happens next.  At this point we 
reach something a bit like the Badlands on the western edge of South 
Dakota - something a bit spooky!

<P>
It's called the Feferman-Sch&uuml;tte ordinal, &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>.
This is just the limit, or union if you prefer, of all the ordinals
mentioned so far: all the ones you can get from the Veblen hierarchy.
You can also define &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> by a fixed point property:
it's the smallest ordinal x with

<P>
&phi;<sub>x</sub>(0) = x

<P>
Now, we've already seen that induction up to different ordinals
gives us different amounts of mathematical power: induction up 
to &omega; is just ordinary mathematical induction as formalized by 
Peano arithmetic, but induction up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> buys us more - 
it lets us prove the consistency of Peano arithmetic! 
 
<P>
Logicians including Feferman and Sch&uuml;tte have carried out a detailed
analysis of this subject.  They know a lot about how much induction up
to different ordinals buys you.  And apparently, induction up to
&Gamma;<sub>0</sub> lets us prove the consistency of a system called
&quot;predicative analysis&quot;.  I don't understand this, nor do I
understand the claim I've seen that &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> is the first
ordinal that cannot be defined predicatively - i.e., can't be defined
without reference to itself.  Sure, saying &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> is the
first solution of

<P>
&phi;<sub>x</sub>(0) = x

<P>
is non-predicative.  But what about saying that &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> is
the union of all ordinals in the Veblen hierarchy?  What's
non-predicative about that?

<P>
If anyone could explain this in simple terms, I'd be much obliged.

<P>
As you can see, I'm getting out my depth here.  That's pretty typical 
in This Week's Finds, but this time - just to shock the world -
I'll take it as a cue to shut up.  So, I won't try to explain the 
outrageously large Bachmann-Howard ordinal, or the even more 
outrageously large Church-Kleene ordinal - the first one that can't 
be written down using <em>any</em> computable system of notation.  You'll 
just have to read the references.

either.

take a system of logic like Peano arithmetic and throw in an
extra axiom saying that system is consistent, and then another
axiom saying <em>that</em> system is consistent, and so on ad infinitum -
getting a new system for each ordinal.  These systems are recursively
axiomatizable up to (but not including) the Church-Kleene ordinal.

Okay, now for a bit about the icosahedron - my favorite Platonic solid.  

<P>
I've been thinking about the &quot;geometric McKay
correspondence&quot; lately, and among other things this sets up a
nice relationship between the symmetry group of the icosahedron and an
amazing entity called E<sub>8</sub>.  E<sub>8</sub> is the largest of
the exceptional Lie groups - it's 248-dimensional.  It's related to
the octonions (the number &quot;8&quot; is no coincidence) and it shows
up in string theory.  It's very beautiful how this complicated
sounding stuff can be seen in distilled form in the icosahedron.

I have a lot to say about this, but you're probably worn out by our

something less stressful - the early history of the icosahedron.

<P>
I spoke about the early history of the dodecahedron in &quot;<A HREF =
"week63.html">week63</A>&quot;.  It's conjectured that the Greeks got
interested in this shape from looking at crystals of iron pyrite.
These aren't regular dodecahedra, since normal crystals can't have
5-fold symmetry - though &quot;quasicrystals&quot; can.  Instead,
they're &quot;pyritohedra&quot;.  The Greeks' love of mathematical
perfection led them to the regular dodecahedron....

<P>
... and it also led them to invent the icosahedron:

According to Artmann, an ancient note written in the margins of a copy 
of Euclid's Elements says the regular icosahedron and octahedron 
were discovered by Theaetetus!  

<P>
If you're a cultured sort, you may know Theaetetus through Plato's 
dialog of the same name, where he's described as a mathematical 
genius.  He's also mentioned in Plato's &quot;The Sophist&quot;.  He probably 
discovered the icosahedron between 380 and 370 BC, and died at an 
early age in 369.  Euclid wrote his construction of the icosahedron 
that we find in Euclid's Elements:

using only my web browser here in Shanghai.

<P>
First of all, if you're imagining an old book in a library somewhere
with marginal notes scribbled by a pal of Theaetetus, dream on.  
It ain't that simple!  Our knowledge of Euclid's original Elements 
relies on copies of copies of copies... and centuries of detective 
work, with each detective having to root through obscure journals 
and dim-lit library basements to learn what the previous detectives 
did.  

<P>
The oldest traces of Euclid's Elements are pathetic fragments of
papyrus.  People found some in a library roasted by the eruption of
Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, some more in a garbage dump in the Egyptian
town of Oxyrhynchus (see &quot;<A HREF =
"week221.html">week221</A>&quot;), and a couple more in the Fayum region
near the Nile.  All these were written centuries after Euclid died.
Here's one from Oxyrhynchus, photographed by Bill Casselman, who 
kindly let me include this picture:

<P>
All these copies are somewhat different.  So, getting at Euclid's 
original Elements is as hard as sequencing the genome of Neanderthal
man, seeing a quark, or peering back to the Big Bang!  

<P>
A lot of these copies contain &quot;scholia&quot;: comments inserted by 
various usually unnamed copyists.  These were collected and
classified by a scholar named Heiberg in the late 1800s:

One or more copies contains a scholium about Platonic solids in 
book XIII.  Which copies?  Ah, for that I'll have to read Heiberg's 
book when I get back to UC Riverside - our library has it, I'm
proud to say.

<P>
And, it turns out that another scholar named Hultsch argued 
that this scholium was written by Geminus of Rhodes.

<P>
Geminus of Rhodes was an astronomer and mathematician who may have 
lived between 130 and 60 BC.  He seems like a cool dude.  In his 
Introduction to Astronomy, he broke open the &quot;celestial sphere&quot;, 
writing:

<blockquote>
  ... we must not suppose that all the stars lie on one surface, 
  but rather that some of them are higher and some are lower.
</blockquote>
And in his Theory of Mathematics, he proved a classification theorem
stating that the helix, the circle and the straight line are the only 
curves for which any portion is the same shape as any other portion 
with the same length.  

<P>
Anyway, the first scholium in book XIII of Euclid's Elements, which
Hultsch attributes to Geminus, mentions

<blockquote>
  ... the five so-called Platonic figures which, however, do not 
  belong to Plato, three of the five being due to the Pythagoreans, 
  namely the cube, the pyramid, and the dodecahedron, while the 
  octahedron and the icosahedron are due to Theaetetus.

As I explained in &quot;<A HREF = "week185.html">week185</A>&quot;, many basic facts about harmonic 
oscillators, Fock space and Feynman diagrams have combinatorial 
interpretations.  For example, the commutation relation between 
the annihilation operator a and the creation operator a*:

<P>
aa* - a*a = 1

<P>
comes from the fact that if you have some balls in a box, there's one
more way to put a ball in and then take one out than to take one out
and then put one in!  This way of thinking amounts to using finite
sets as a substitute for the usual eigenstates of the number operator,
so we're really &quot;categorifying&quot; the harmonic oscillator:
giving it a category of states instead of a set of states.

Working out the detailed consequences takes us through Joyal's theory

 Without &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> you can't prove that Goodstein sequences 
 converge to zero - an obviously true fact.  As I mentioned, the main use 
 of these ordinals is to measure the strength of axiom systems.  But, 
 I didn't write about these ordinals because they're useful.  I wrote 
 about them because they're fun.   

<P>
 They're not &quot;ridiculously infinite&quot;, though.  The ordinals 
 I mentioned
 are all countable ordered sets, and you can describe them all 
 <em>explicitly</em> as subsets of the rational numbers.  

<P>
 More precisely: any one of the ordinals I mentioned, up to and including
 the Feferman-Sch&uuml;tte ordinal (and quite a ways beyond), is isomorphic 
 as an ordered set to a subset of the rational numbers.  Moreover, you 
 can write a computer program that will decide whether or not any given 
 fraction is in this subset.  As a consequence, you can also write a 
 computer program that lists the fractions in this set.  

<P>
 It's pretty obvious how to do this for &omega;<sup>2</sup>:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN = CENTER>
<IMG SRC = "omega_squared.png">
</DIV>

 But you can do it for any one of the ordinals I mentioned!  David
 Madore has drawn a picture of &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>, for example.

<P>
 So, for someone to reject these ordinals as "ridiculously infinite",
 they must have some doubts about the legitimacy of computable subsets 
 of the rational numbers as valid objects of study.  That seems like 
 an extreme position.

<P>
 The Church-Kleene ordinal is much larger than any of the ordinals
 I discussed in detail.  It's still countable.  Any ordinal below it
 can be described in a computable way - but it itself can't.  So, if
 you believe that only computable mathematical entities are worth 
 studying, you might want to stop shy of this one.   I stopped <em>far</em>
 short of this one.

 I hope you see that this is not true for the countable ordinals I 
 was discussing.  I deliberately refrained from mentioning the large 
 cardinals that logicians often discuss, precisely because I share 
 your distaste for such stuff.

<P>
 I realized after I posted &quot;<A HREF = "week236.html">week236</A>&quot; 
 that some people might think I was
 talking about mystical entities, when I was actually talking about very
 concrete things.  So, I'm glad you brought this up.

And now for Kevin Buzzard's wonderful calculation! 
In the original version of this Week's Finds, I wrote:

<blockquote>
if you start with the number 4, you get this Goodstein sequence:
<P>
 4, 26, 41, 60, 83, 109, 139, 173, 211, 253, 299, 348, ...
<P>
 and apparently it takes about 3 &times; 10<sup>60605351</sup> 
steps to reach zero!
</blockquote>

I got this figure from the &quot;National Curve Bank&quot; website mentioned
above, but I got the details wrong: they said the sequence
&quot;can increase for approximately 2.6 &times; 10<sup>60605351</sup>
steps&quot;, whatever that means.

<P>
Kevin Buzzard then sent me an email in which he worked out the
number himself.  After correcting a few small mistakes, we seem
to have settled on a different answer.  

<P>
Kevin writes:

<PRE>
 You write this as if it were some kind of mystery. I remember working
 out this number explicitly when I was a graduate student!  There is
 some nice form for it, as I recall.  Let's see if I can reconstruct
 what I did.

 If I've understood the sequence correctly, it should be (where "n)" 
 at the beginning of a line denotes we're working in base n on this 
 line, so strictly speaking it's probably the n-1st term in the sequence)
 
 2) 2^2 = 4
 3) 3^3-1 = 2.3^2+2.3+2 = 26 [note: base 3, ends in 2, and 3+2=5]
 4) 2.4^2+2.4+1 = 41 [note: base 4, ends in 1, and 4+1=5]
 5) 2.5^2+2.5 = 60 [we're at a limit ordinal here, note 3+2=4+1=5]
 6) 2.6^2+2.6-1 = 2.6^2+6+5 = 83 [note: base 6, ends in 5]
 7) 2.7^2+7+4 [note: base 7, ends in 4]
 8) 2.8^2+8+3 [note: base 8, ends in 3, so we next get a limit ordinal at...]
 .
 .
 11) 2.11^2+11
 12) 2.12^2+12-1 = 2.12^2+11
 13) 2.13^2+10
 .
 .
 .
 23) 2.23^2 (as 23 = 12+11 = 13+10= ...)
 24) 24^2+23.24+23
 .
 .
 .
 47) 47^2+23.47
 48) 48^2+22.48+47
 .
 .
 .
 95) 95^2+22.95
 96) 96^2+21.96+95
 .
 .
 .
 
 and now we spot a pattern: we're just doubling---getting a limit ordinal
 at bases 24-1, 48-1, 96-1 and so on. Let's look again at those limit
 ordinals:
 
 47) 47^2+23.47
 95) 95^2+22.95
 .
 .
 .
 24*2^t-1) (24*2^t-1)^2+(24-t)*(24*2^t-1)
 .
 .
 .
 
 so the last one with a square in it will be the case t=24, corresponding 
 to
 
 r) r^2
 
 where 
 
 r = 24 * 2^24 - 1 = 402653183. 
 
 All those 24s, but I'm sure you'll not get carried away.  Let's define 

 n = r+1 = 24 * 2^24 

 and continue on. At the next step, the ordinal decreases sharply:

 n)      n^2-1 = (n-1)n + (n-1)
 n+1)   (n-1)(n+1) + (n-2) [note: now back to the usual tricks]
 .
 .
 .
 2n-1) (n-1)(2n-1)        [the next limit, at base 2n-1]
 2n)   (n-2)(2n) + (2n-1)
 .
 .
 .
 4n-1) (n-2)(4n-1)
 4n)   (n-2)(4n)+(4n-1)
 .
 .
 .
 
 and the limit ordinals we're running into now (and we're going to
 run into about n of them, which is a lot), are
 
 2n-1)      (n-1)(2n-1)
 4n-1)      (n-2)(4n-1)
 8n-1)      (n-3)(8n-1)
 .
 .
 .
 n2^s-1)    (n-s)(n2^s - 1)
 .
 .
 .
 
 and finally when s = n-1
 
 m)           m
 
 where m = n 2^{n-1} - 1.  The sequence now looks like
 
 m+1) (m+1)-1 = m  
 m+2)  m-1        
 m+3)  m-2
 .
 .
 .
 2m+1) 0
 
 So the sequence becomes zero at base n2^n - 1, where n = 24 * 2^24.
 If 2^2 is the first term in the sequence, I guess this is
 the (n2^n - 2)th term.  I make this about 6.9*10^{121210694} -
 curses, you got something else!  Actually, I have about the square
 of what you wrote and hence I have most likely made a slip.  On the 
 other hand you can see that it's not a mystery at all, it's just an
 elementary exercise.  It really helps you learn about why the 
 countable ordinals are well-ordered too: as you continue working
 out the numbers, you always have this impending sense of doom 
 telling you that your gut feeling that the sequence tends to 
 infinity might just be wrong...

</PRE>

So, in simple terms, the 4th Goodstein sequence starts out by 
shooting up faster and faster, reaching almost n<sup>2</sup> 
by the nth term, where 

<P>
n = 24 &middot; 2<sup>24</sup> = 402653184.

<P>
By the (2n)th term it reaches almost 2n<sup>2</sup>.  

<P>
Then it grows by steps of n-2, and 
by the (4n)th term it reaches almost 4n<sup>2</sup>.

<P>
Then it grows by steps of n-3, and
by the (8n)th term it reaches almost 8n<sup>2</sup>.

<P>
And so on... it's slowing down now.

<P>
After about the (2<sup>n-2</sup>n)th term it levels off completely,
and by the (2<sup>n-1</sup>n)th term it equals almost 2<sup>n-1</sup>n. 
Note these numbers are the same.

<P>
From this point on the sequence decreases by one each time, and it 
hits zero at about the (2<sup>n</sup> n)th term.

<P>
So, it spends the last half of its life decreasing by one each
time.  Right before that, it spends a quarter of its life remaining
constant.  Right before that, it spends an eighth of its life growing
by one each time.  Right before that it, it spends a sixteenth of its
life growning by two each time.  And so on, but not indefinitely:
this description covers the phase after the nth term.

<P>
In particular, it reaches its maximum and then levels off after about 
quarter of its life is done.  It spends about the next quarter of its
life being constant, and the next half going down one step at a time.
<P>

Let's be a bit more precise.  For this let's call the ith term of 
the 4th Goodstein sequence a<sub>i</sub>, where we count things so that

<PRE>
a<sub>1</sub> = 4, a<sub>2</sub> = 26, ...
</PRE>

<P>
Then a<sub>i</sub> first reaches its maximum value at exactly 

<PRE>
i = (1/4) 24 2<sup>24</sup> 2<sup>(24 2<sup>24</sup>)</sup> - 2 

  ~  1.72 &times; 10<sup>121210694</sup>
</PRE>

<P>
Its value at this point is exactly 

<PRE>
a<sub>i</sub> = (1/2) 24 2<sup>24</sup> 2<sup>(24 2<sup>24</sup>)</sup> - 1

  ~  3.45 &times; 10<sup>121210694</sup>
</PRE>

It then stays constant for about twice as many more terms, and 
then goes to zero one step at a time, hitting zero precisely when

<PRE>
i = 24 2<sup>24</sup> 2<sup>(24 2<sup>24</sup>)</sup> - 2
  
  ~ 6.89 &times; 10<sup>121210694</sup>
</PRE>

Believe me, it's a lot more fun to figure this stuff out than to
read it.  

<P>
I was worried that Kevin and I had made a mistake until we found
this thesis which gets the same answer (though the author starts the
sequence at a<sub>0</sub> = 4, so it looks one off from ours):

Tim Chow had some comments about why the Feferman-Sch&uuml;tte ordinal 
is considered the first &quot;impredicative&quot; ordinal.  He wrote:

</PRE>

 The situation is somewhat akin to the situation with the
 Church-Turing thesis, in that one is tentatively equating an informal
 notion (predicativity or computability) with a precise mathematical
 notion.  Therefore there is no definitive answer to your question,
 and Feferman himself has articulated potential objections to the
 &quot;standard view&quot; that &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> marks the boundary
 of predicativity.
 
<P>
 Having said that, I'll also say that one of the reasons for the
 standard view is that &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> marks the boundary of
 &quot;autonomous progressions&quot; of arithmetical theories.  The
 book by Torkel Franzen that you cited is probably the most accessible
 introduction to this subject.  Roughly speaking, the idea is that if
 anyone fully accepts first-order Peano arithmetic PA, then implicitly
 he accepts its consistency Con(PA), as well as Con(PA+Con(PA)), etc.
 If one tries to articulate exactly what is &quot;implicitly&quot;
 involved in accepting PA in this sense, then one can make a
 plausibility argument that &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> is a natural stopping
 point.  I think you have a better shot at grasping the underlying
 intuition via this approach than by staring at &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>
 itself and trying to figure out what is non-predicative about its
 definition.
</blockquote>

I replied asking if &quot;etc.&quot; means there's one theory like this
per ordinal.  I also asked for more clues about this &quot;plausibility
argument&quot;, and noted:

<blockquote>
 There's also someone named Nik Weaver who has debated Feferman
 on this subject:

 <a href = "http://www.math.wustl.edu/~nweaver/conceptualism.html">http://www.math.wustl.edu/~nweaver/conceptualism.html</a>

<P>
 He seems to claim that &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> 
 and even larger ordinals have predicative
 definitions.  However, I'm too ignorant to follow this debate.
 Usually in physics I have a sense for when people are being reasonable
 even if I don't follow the details.  In this debate I can't even
 do that.
</blockquote>

Tim Chow replied:

<blockquote>
 Let's look more closely at what the notion of &quot;one theory like
 this per ordinal&quot; means.  There's no difficulty figuring out
 what &quot;Con(PA)&quot; means or how to express that statement in
 the first-order language of arithmetic.  Ditto with
 &quot;Con(PA+Con(PA))&quot;.  However, once you start ascending the
 ordinal hierarchy, a difficulty appears.  The language of arithmetic
 doesn't let you talk about &quot;ordinals&quot; directly---that's a
 set-theoretical concept.  In order to express a statement like
 &quot;Con(T)&quot; for some theory T, you need at minimum to be able
 to give some sort of &quot;recursive description&quot; or
 &quot;recursive axiomatization&quot; of T (where here I use the word
 &quot;recursive&quot; in the technical sense of recursive function
 theory) in the first-order language of arithmetic.  This observation
 already yields the intuition that we're not going to be able to
 ascend beyond the Church-Kleene ordinal, because we won't even be
 able to figure out how to <em>say</em> &quot;T is consistent&quot; for a
 theory T that requires that many iterations to reach from PA.

<P>
 There are other problems, though, that potentially get in the way before
 we reach the Church-Kleene ordinal.  Once we realize that what we need is
 a system of &quot;ordinal notations&quot; to &quot;fake&quot; the relevant set theory, we may
 (if we are predicativists) worry about issues such as:
 
<P>
 1. As we ascend the ordinal hierarchy, isn't it illegitimate to make a 
 jump to an ordinal &alpha; unless we've already proved, at the level of some
 ordinal &beta; that we've already reached, that an ordinal of type &alpha;
 exists?

<P>
 2. And isn't it illegitimate to create sets by quantification over things
 other than the natural numbers themselves and sets that we've already
 created?

<P>
 Condition 1 goes by the name of &quot;autonomy&quot; and condition 2
 goes by the name of &quot;ramification.&quot; If one formalizes these
 notions in a certain plausible manner, then one arrives at
 &Gamma;<sub>0</sub> as the least upper bound of theories that you can
 get to, starting with (for example) PA.

<P>
 One can of course wonder whether 1 and 2 above really capture the
 concept of &quot;predicativity.&quot; Some secondary evidence has
 accumulated of the following form: Some argument that intuitively
 seems to be predicative but that is not immediately seen to be
 provable in the Feferman-Sch&uuml;tte framework is shown, after some
 work, to indeed be provable below &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>.
 
<P>
 It's still possible, of course, for someone---you mentioned Nik Weaver---
 to come along and argue that our intuitive notion of predicativism, fuzzy
 though it is, can't possibly be identified with the level &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>.  The
 reason you can't seem to decide immediately whether Weaver's position is
 nonsensical or not is probably because the critical questions are not
 mathematical but philosophical, and of course it's usually harder to 
 arrive at definitive answers in philosophy than in mathematics.
</blockquote>

Finally, let me record a number of papers that treat notations for
ordinals above the Feferman-Sch&uuml;tte ordinal.  In the discussion
of this Week's Finds on sci.math.research, Dave Renfro pointed out a 
really nice readable paper on large countable ordinals which goes
