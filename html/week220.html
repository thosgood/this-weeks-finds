<P>
Work on quantum gravity has seemed stagnant and stuck for the 
last couple of years, which is why I've been turning more
towards pure math.  

<P>
Over in string theory they're contemplating a vast &quot;landscape&quot; of 
possible universes, each with their own laws of physics - one or
more of which might be ours.  Each one is supposed to correspond
to a different &quot;vacuum&quot; or &quot;background&quot; for the 
marvelous unifying
M-theory that we don't completely understand yet.  They can't 
choose the right vacuum except by the good old method of fitting 
the experimental data.  But these days, this time-honored method 
gets a lot less airplay than the &quot;anthropic principle&quot;:

<P>
1) Leonard Susskind, The anthropic landscape of string theory,
available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0302219">hep-th/0302219</A>.

<P>
Perhaps this is because it's more grandiose to imagine choosing 
one theory out of a multitude by discovering that it's among the 
few that supports intelligent life, than by noticing that it 
correctly predicts experimental results.  Or, perhaps it's because
nobody really knows how to get string theory to predict experimental
results!  Even after you chose a vacuum, you'd need to see how
supersymmetry gets broken, and this remain quite obscure.

<P>
There's still tons of beautiful math coming out of string theory,
mind you: right now I'm just talking about physics.
 
<P>
What about loop quantum gravity?  This line of research has always 
been less ambitious than string theory.  Instead of finding the 
correct theory of everything, its goal has merely been to find 
<em>any</em> theory that combines gravity and quantum mechanics in a 
background-free way.  But, it has major problems of its own:
nobody knows how it can successfully mimic general relativity
at large length scales, as it must to be realistic!  Old-fashioned
perturbative quantum gravity failed on this score because it 
wasn't renormalizable.  Loop quantum gravity may get around this
somehow... but it's about time to see exactly how.

<P>
Loop quantum gravity follows two main approaches: the so-called
&quot;Hamiltonian&quot; or &quot;spin network&quot; approach, which focuses on the 
geometry of space at a given time, and the so-called &quot;Lagrangian&quot; 
or &quot;spin foam&quot; approach, which focuses on the geometry of 
spacetime. 

<P>
In the last couple of years, the most interesting new work in the 
Hamiltonian approach has focussed on problems with extra symmetry,
like black holes and the big bang.  Here's a nontechnical 
introduction:

<A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0410054">gr-qc/0410054</A>.

<P>
and here's some new work that treats the information loss
puzzle:

<P>
3) Abhay Ashtekar and Martin Bojowald, Black hole evaporation:
a paradigm, Class. Quant. Grav. 22 (2005) 3349-3362.  Also
available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0504029">gr-qc/0504029</A>.

<P>
However, by focusing on solutions with extra symmetry, one puts 
off facing the hardest aspects of renormalization, or whatever
its equivalent might be in loop quantum gravity.

<P>
The other approach - the spin foam approach - got stalled when 
the most popular model seemed to give spacetimes made mostly of 
squashed-flat &quot;degenerate 4-simplexes&quot;.  Various papers have
found an effect like this: see &quot;<A HREF = "week198.html">week198</A>&quot; for more details.  So,
there's definitely a real phenomenon going on here.   However, 
its physical significance remains a bit obscure.  The devil is
in the details. 

<P>
In particular, even though the <em>amplitude</em> for a single large 
4-simplex in the Barrett-Crane model is dominated by degenerate 
geometries, certain <em>second derivatives</em> of the amplitude might not -
and this may be what really matters.  Carlo Rovelli has recently
come out with a paper on this:

<P>

quantum gravity, available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0508124">gr-qc/0508124</A>.

<P>
If the idea holds up, I'll be pretty excited.  If not, I'll be
bummed.  But luckily, I've already gone through the withdrawal 
pains of switching my focus away from quantum gravity.   When you 
do theoretical physics, sometimes you feel the high of discovering 
hidden truths about the physical universe.  Sometimes you feel the
agony of suspecting that those &quot;hidden truths&quot; were probably just
a bunch of baloney... or, realizing that you may never know.  
Ultimately nature has the last word.  

<P>
Math is, at least for me, a less nerve-racking pursuit, since 
the truths we find can be confirmed simply by discussing them: 
we don't need to wait for experiment.  Math is just as grand as 
physics, or more so.  But it's more wispy and ethereal, since it's
about pure pattern in general - not the particular magic patterns 
that became the world we see.  So, the stakes are lower, but the 
odds are higher.

<P>
Speaking of math, I really want to talk about the Streetfest - the 
conference in honor of Ross Street's 60th birthday.  It was a real 
blast: over sixty talks in two weeks in two cities, Sydney and 
Canberra.  However, I accidentally left my notes from those talks 
at home before zipping off to Calgary for a summer school on 
homotopy theory:

<P>
5) Topics in Homotopy Theory, graduate summer school at the 
Pacific Institute of Mathematics run by Kristine Bauer and Laura 
Scull.  Recommended reading material available at 
<A HREF = "http://www.pims.math.ca/science/2005/05homotopy/reading.html">
http://www.pims.math.ca/science/2005/05homotopy/reading.html</A>

<P>
So, I'll say a bit about what I learned at this school.  

<P>
Dan Dugger spoke about motivic homotopy theory, which was
<em>great</em>, because I've been trying to understand stuff
from number theory and algebraic geometry like the Weil 
conjectures, etale cohomology, motives, and Voevodsky's proof 
of the Milnor conjecture... and thanks to his wonderfully 
pedagogical lectures, it's all starting to make some sense!

<P>
I hope to talk about this someday, but not now.

<P>
Alejandro Adem spoke about orbifolds and group cohomology.
Purely personally, the most exciting thing here was seeing
that orbifolds can also be seen as certain kinds of topological 
groupoids, or stacks, or topoi... so that various versions of
&quot;categorified topology&quot; are actually different faces of the 
same thing!
  
<P>
I may talk about this someday, too, but not now.

<P>
I spoke about higher gauge theory and its relation to Eilenberg-Mac 
Lane spaces.  I may talk about that too someday, but not now.

<P>
Dev Sinha spoke about operads, and besides explaining the basics, 
he said a couple of things that really blew me away.  So, I want
to talk about this now.

<P>
For one, the homology of the little k-cubes operad is a graded 
version of the Poisson operad!  For two, the little 2-cubes 
operad acts on the space of thickened long knots!  

<P>
But for this to thrill you like it thrills me, I'd better say a
word about operads - and especially little k-cubes operads.

<P>
Operads, and especially the little k-cubes operads, were 
invented by Peter May in the early 1970s to formalize the 
algebraic structures lurking in &quot;infinite loop spaces&quot;.  In 
&quot;<A HREF = "week149.html">week149</A>&quot; I explained what infinite loop spaces are, and how 
they give generalized cohomology theories, but let's not get 
bogged down in this motivation now, since operads are actually
quite simple.  

<P>
In its simplest form, an operad is a gizmo that has for each 
n = 0,1,2,... a set O(n) whose elements are thought of as n-ary 
operations - operations with n inputs.  It's good to draw such 
operations as black boxes with n input wires and one output:  

<PRE>
                  \    |    /
                   \   |   / 
                    \  |  /
                     -----
                    |  f  | 
                     -----
                       |
                       |
</PRE>
For starters these operations are purely abstract things that
don't actually operate on anything.  Only when we consider a
&quot;representation&quot; or &quot;action&quot; of an operad do they get incarnated
as actual n-ary operations on some set.   The point of operads is 
to study their actions. 

<P>
But, for completeness, let me sketch the definition of an operad.
An operad tells us how to compose its operations, like this:

<PRE>
         \    /     \  |  /       | 
          \  /       \ | /        |
          -----      -----      -----
         |  b  |    |  c  |    |  d  |
          -----      -----      -----
              \        |        /  
               \       |       /
                \      |      /
                 \     |     /
                  \    |    / 
                   \   |   /  
                    \  |  /
                     -----
                    |  a  | 
                     -----
                       |
                       |
</PRE>
Here we are composing a with b,c, and d to get an operation with 6 
inputs called a o (b,c,d).

<P>
An operad needs to have a unary operation serving as the identity 
for composition.  It also needs to satisfy an &quot;associative law&quot; 
that makes a composite of composites like this well-defined:


<PRE>
              \    /   |  \  |  /   \     / 
               \  /    |   \ | /     \   / 
                ---   ---   ---       ---
               |   | |   | |   |     |   |
                ---   ---   ---       ---
                   \   |   /          /
                    \  |  /          / 
                     \ | /          / 
          -----      -----      -----
         |     |    |     |    |     |
          -----      -----      -----
              \        |        /  
               \       |       /   
                \      |      /
                 \     |     / 
                  \    |    / 
                   \   |   /   
                    \  |  /
                     -----
                    |     | 
                     -----
                       |
                       |
</PRE>
(This picture has a 0-ary operation in it, just to emphasize
that this is allowed.)  

<P>
That's the complete definition of a &quot;planar operad&quot;.  In a 
full-fledged operad we can do more: we can permute the inputs 
of any operation and get a new operation:
                      
<PRE>
                      \ /   /
                       /   /
                      / \ /    
                     /   /   
                    /   / \
                    \  |  /
                     -----
                    |     | 
                     -----
                       |
                       |
</PRE>
This gives actions of the permutation groups on the sets O(n).  
We also demand that these actions be compatible with composition, 
in a way that's supposed to be obvious from the pictures.   For 
example:


<PRE>
       \  |  /   |   \   /               \\\ /   / /
        \ | /    |    \ /                 \\/   / /
         ---    ---   ---                  /\\ / /
        | a |  | b | | c |                / \\/ /
         ---    ---   ---                /   / /
           \     /   /                  /   / /\\
            \   /   /                  /   | | \\\  
             \ /   /                  /    | |  \\\
              /   /                  ---   ---   ---
             / \ /           =      | b | | c | | a |
            /   /                    ---   ---   ---
           /   / \                      \   |   /
           \  |  /                       \  |  /
            -----                         -----
           |  d  |                       |  d  | 
            -----                         -----
              |                             |
              |                             |
</PRE>
and similarly for permuting the inputs of the black boxes on
top.

<P>
<em>Voil&agrave;!</em>

<P>
Now, operads make sense in various contexts.  So far we've been 
talking about operads that have a <em>set</em> O(n) of n-ary operations 
for each n.  These have actions on <em>sets</em>, where each guy in O(n) 
gets incarnated as a <em>function</em> that eats n elements of some set 
and spits out an element of that set. 

<P>
But historically, Peter May started by inventing operads that have 
a <em>topological space</em> of n-ary operations for each n.  These like 
to act on <em>topological spaces</em>, with the operations getting 
incarnated as <em>continuous maps</em>.     

<P>
Most importantly, he invented an operad called the &quot;little k-cubes 
operad&quot;.  Here O(n) is the space of ways of putting n nonoverlapping
little k-dimensional cubes in a big one.  We don't demand that
the little cubes are actually cubes: they can be rectangular
boxes.  We do demand that their walls are nicely lined up with 
the walls of the big cube:


<PRE>
        ---------------------
       |                     |
       |           -----     |
       | -----    |     |    | 
       ||     |   |     |    |
       ||     |   |     |    |           typical  
       | -----    |     |    |     3-ary operation in the       
       |           -----     |     little 2-cubes operad
       |   ----------------  |
       |  |                | |
       |   ----------------  |
       |                     |
        ---------------------

</PRE>
This is an operation in O(3), where O is the little 2-cubes
operad.  Or, at least it would be if I labelled each of the 3 
little 2-cubes - we need that extra information.  

<P>
We compose operations by sticking pictures like this into 
each of the little k-cubes in another picture like this!  
I should draw you an example, but I'm too lazy.  So, figure
it out yourself and check the associative law.

<P>
The reason this example is so important is that we get an action
of the little k-cubes operad whenever we have a &quot;k-fold loop 
space&quot;.  

<P>
Starting from a space S equipped with a chosen point *, the 
k-fold loop space &Omega;<sup>k</sup>(S) is the space of all maps from
a k-sphere into S that send the north pole to the point *.  But
this is also the space of all maps from a k-cube into S sending 
the boundary of the k-cube to the point *.  

<P>
So, given n such such maps, we can glom them together using an 
n-ary operation in the little k-cubes operad:

<PRE>
        ---------------------
       |*********************|
       |***********-----*****|
       |*-----****|     |****| 
       ||     |***|     |****|
       ||     |***|     |****|
       | ----- ***|     |****|
       |***********-----*****|
       |***----------------**|
       |**|                |*|
       |***----------------**|
       |*********************|
        ---------------------
</PRE>
where we map all the shaded stuff to the point *.  We get 
another map from the k-cube to S sending the boundary to *.
So: 

<P>
<div align = center>
             ANY k-FOLD LOOP SPACE HAS AN ACTION OF <br>
                  THE LITTLE k-CUBES OPERAD
</div>

<P>
But the really cool part is the converse: 

<P>
<div align = center>
           ANY CONNECTED POINTED SPACE WITH AN ACTION OF <br>
                THE LITTLE k-CUBES OPERAD IS  <br>
         HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENT TO A k-FOLD LOOP SPACE
</div>

<P>
This is too technical to make a good bumper sticker, so if you 
want people in your neighborhood to get interested in operads, 
I suggest combining both the above slogans into one:

<P>
<div align = center>
            A k-FOLD LOOP SPACE IS THE SAME AS <br>
          AN ACTION OF THE LITTLE k-CUBES OPERAD                  
</div>
<P>
Like any good slogan, this leaves out some important fine print, 
but it <A HREF = "churchsign.jpg">gets the basic idea across</A>.  
Modulo some details, being a
k-fold loop space amounts to having a bunch of operations: one
for each way of stuffing little k-cubes in a big one!

<P>
By the way:

<P>
Speaking of bumper stickers, I'm in Montreal now, and there's
a funky hangout on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent called Cafe &pi;
where people play chess - and they sell T-shirts, key rings, 
baseball caps and coffee mugs decorated with the Greek letter &pi;!  
The T-shirts are great if you're going for a kind of math-nerd/punk 
look; I got one to wow the students in my undergraduate 
courses.  I don't usually provide links to commercial websites, 
but I made an exception for Acme Klein Bottles, and I'll make an 
exception for Cafe &pi;:

<P>
6) Cafe &pi;, <A HREF = "http://www.cafepi.ca/">http://www.cafepi.ca/</A>

<P>
Unfortunately they don't sell bumper stickers.

<P>
But where were we?  Ah yes - the little k-cubes operad.

<P>
The little k-cubes operad sits in the little (k+1)-cubes operad 
in an obvious way.  Indeed, it's a &quot;sub-operad&quot;.  So, we can 
take the limit as k goes to &infin; and form the &quot;little 
&infin;-cubes operad&quot;.  Any infinite loop space gets an action 
of this... and that's why Peter May invented operads!

<P>
You can read more about these ideas in May's book:

<P>
7) J. Peter May, The Geometry of Iterated Loop Spaces, 
Lecture Notes in Mathematics 271, Springer, Berlin, 1972.

<P>
or for a more gentle treatment, try this expository article:

<P>
8) J. Peter May, Infinite loop space theory, Bull. Amer. Math. 
Soc. 83 (1977), 456-494.

<P>
But Dev Sinha told us about some subsequent work by Fred 
Cohen, who computed the homology and cohomology of the little
k-cubes operad.

<P>
For this, we need to think about operads in the world of linear 
algebra.  Here we consider operads that have a <em>vector space</em> of 
n-ary operations for each n, which get incarnated as <em>multilinear
maps</em> when they act on some <em>vector space</em>.  These are sometimes 
called &quot;linear operads&quot;.

<P>
An example is the operad for Lie algebras.   This one is called 
&quot;Lie&quot;.  Lie(n) is the vector space of n-ary operations that one 
can do whenever one has a Lie algebra.  In this example:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
 Lie(0) is zero-dimensional, since there are no nullary operations 
 (constants) built into the definition of Lie algebra, except zero.


<P>
<LI>
 Lie(1) is one-dimensional, since the only unary operations are 
 multiples of the identity operation:

<P>
  a &rarr; a


<P>
<LI>
 Lie(2) is one-dimensional, since the only binary operations are 
 multiples of the Lie bracket:

<P>
  (a,b) &rarr; [a,b]

<P>
 You might think we need a second guy in Lie(2), namely

<P>
  (a,b) &rarr; [b,a]

<P>
 but the antisymmetry of the Lie bracket says this is linearly 
 dependent on the first one:

<P>
  [b,a] = -[a,b]


<P>
<LI>
 Lie(3) is two-dimensional, since the only ternary operations 
 are linear combinations of these two:

<P>
  (a,b,c) &rarr; [[a,b],c]  <br>
  (a,b,c) &rarr; [b,[a,c]]

<P>
 You might think we need a third guy in Lie(3), for example

<P>
  (a,b,c) &rarr; [a,[b,c]]

<P>
 but the Jacobi identity says this is linearly dependent on the 
 first two:

<P>
  [a,[b,c]] = [[a,b],c] + [b,[a,c]]
</UL>

<P>
You may enjoy trying to show that the dimension of Lie(n) is 
(n - 1)!, at least for n &gt; 0.  There's an incredibly beautiful
conceptual proof, and probably lots of obnoxious brute-force
proofs.  

<P>
There's a lot more to say about the Lie operad, but right now 
I want to talk about the Poisson operad.  A &quot;Poisson algebra&quot; 
is a commutative associative algebra that has a bracket operation 
{a,b} making it into a Lie algebra, with the property that 

<P>
  {a,bc} = {a,b}c + b{a,c}

<P>
So, bracketing with any element is like taking a derivative: it 
satisfies the product rule.   

<P>
For this reason, Poisson algebras arise naturally as algebras of 
observables in classical mechanics - the Poisson bracket of any 
observable A with an observable H called the &quot;Hamiltonian&quot; tells 
you the time derivative of A:

<P>
dA/dt = {H,A}

<P>
This is the beginning of a nice big story.  

<P>
But, what's got me excited now is how Poisson algebras show up in 
topology!

<P>
To understand this, we need to note that there's a linear operad 
whose algebras are Poisson algebras.  That's not surprising.  But,
we can get a very similar operad in a rather shocking way, as 
follows.
  
<P>
Take the little k-cubes operad.  This has a space O(n) of n-ary 
operations for each n.  Now take the homology of these spaces 
O(n), using coefficients in your favorite field, and get vector 
spaces H(O(n)).  By functorial abstract nonsense these form a 
linear operad.  And this is the operad for Poisson algebras!

<P>
Alas, we actually have to be a bit more careful.  The homology of 
each space 
O(n) with coefficients in some field is really a <em>graded</em> vector 
space over that field.  So, taking the homology of the little k-cubes
operad gives an operad in the 
category of graded vector spaces.  And, it's the operad whose 
algebras are graded Poisson algebras with a bracket of degree k-1. 

<P>
What are those?  Well, they're like Poisson algebras, but if a is an 
element of degree |a| and b is an element of degree |b|, then:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
 ab has degree |a| + |b|    
&nbsp;&nbsp;       
&nbsp;&nbsp;       
&nbsp;&nbsp;       
&nbsp;&nbsp;       
&nbsp;&nbsp;       
&nbsp;&nbsp;       
&nbsp;&nbsp;       
&nbsp;&nbsp;       
 (we've got a graded algebra)
<P>
<LI>
 {a,b} has degree |a| + |b| + k - 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; (with a bracket of degree k-1)
</UL>

<P>
and the usual axioms for a Poisson algebra hold, but sprinkled 
with minus signs according to the usual yoga of graded vector 
spaces.

<P>
So: whenever we have a k-fold loop space, its homology is a graded 
Poisson algebra with a bracket of degree k-1.   

<P>
To get an idea of this works, let me sketch how the product and 
the bracket work.  Suppose we have an space X with an action of 
the little k-cubes operad:  

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
 The product on homology corresponds to sticking two little cubes 
 side by side.  Given two points in X, this gives another point in 
 X.  More generally, given two homology classes a and b in X, we
 get a homology class of degree |a| + |b| in X.

<P>
<LI>
 The bracket comes from taking one little cube and moving it around 
 to trace out a sphere surrounding the other little cube.  Given
 two points in X, this gives a (k-1)-sphere in X.   More generally, 
 given a homology class a in X, and a homology class b in X, we 
 get a homology class {a,b} of degree |a| + |b| + k - 1.
</UL>

<P>
The equation

<P>
  {a,bc} = {a,b}c + b{a,c}

<P>
then says &quot;moving a around b and c is like moving a around b while
c stands by, plus moving a around c while b stands by&quot;. 

<P>
I guess this result can be found here:

operads!  Dev Sinha has a paper where he takes these ideas and

trees starting from the homology and cohomology (respectively)
of the little k-cubes operad!  He first wrote about it here:

I have a vague feeling that this relation between the little
k-cubes operad and the Poisson operad is part of a big picture
involving braids and quantization.  Another hint in this direction
is Deligne's Conjecture, now proved in many ways, which says that 
the operad of singular chains coming from the little 2-disks 
operad acts on the Hochschild cochain complex of any associative 
algebra.  Since Hochschild cohomology classifies the ways you
can deform an associative algebra, this result is related to 
quantization and Poisson algebras.  But, I don't get the big 
picture!  This might help:

<P>
I'd like to ponder this now!  But I'm getting tired, and I still 
need to say how the little 2-cubes operad acts on the space of 
thickened long knots.
  
<P>
What's a thickened long knot?  In k dimensions, it's an embedding
of a little k-cube in a big one:

<P>
f: [0,1]<sup>k</sup> &rarr; [0,1]<sup>k</sup>

<P>
subject to the condition that the top and bottom of the little 
cube get mapped to the top and bottom of the big one via the 
identity map.  So, you should imagine a thickened long knot as 
a fat square rope going from the ceiling to the floor, all tied 
up in knots.

<P>
There are two ways to &quot;compose&quot; thickened long knots.  

<P>
If you're a knot theorist, the obvious way is to stick one on top 
of the other - just like the usual composition of tangles.  But if 
you just think of thickened long knots as functions, you can also 
compose them just by composing functions!  This amounts to
stuffing one knot inside another... a little hard to visualize,
but fun.

<P>
Anyway, it turns out that the whole little 2-cubes operad acts
on the space of thickened long knots, with the two operations
I just mentioned corresponding to this:

This isn't supposed to make obvious sense, but the point is, there
are lots of binary operations interpolating between these two - 
one for each binary operation in the little 2-cubes operad!

<P>
This gives a new proof that the operation of &quot;sticking one 
thickened long knot on top of another&quot; is commutative up to
homotopy.  

<P>
And, using these ideas, Ryan Budney has managed to figure out a 
lot of information about the homotopy type of the space of long 
knots.  Check out these papers:

The paper by Budney and Cohen combines the two ideas I just 
described - the action of the little 2-cubes operad on thickened 
long knots and its relation to the Poisson operad.  Using these,
they show that the rational homology of the space of thickened 
long knots in 3 dimensions is a free Poisson algebra!  They also 
show that the mod-p homology of this space is a free &quot;restricted 
Poisson&quot; algebra.

<b>Addendum:</b> 
Jesse McKeown had a question about the two operations on long thickened
knots.  Here's what he asked:

<blockquote>
Perhaps I'm being too imaginative, but I don't feel very convinced the two
operations described towards the end of &quot;week220&quot; 
are fundamentally different.
 
<P>
VagueSpecifically, in map-composition, can't one stretch all the knottednes
of the first composand into an &quot;upper&quot;, essentially unknotty 
portion of the second composand, and similarly squish the knottedness 
of the second composand into a &quot;lower&quot; section of the big 
all-encompassing box?

Right!   That's exactly what having an action of the little 2-cubes

because there is a continuous family of operations interpolating
between these - one for each way of sticking two little squares
in a big one.
<P>
But, the <em>process</em> 
of moving from operation A to operation B is itself 
nontrivial.  If you loop all the way around from A to B to A - moving
the two little squares around each other in the big one - you can 
get a noncontractible loop in the space of long thickened knots!
<P>
And, this is what gives the bracket operation on the homology 
of the space of thickened long knots.

Operads were born to deal with issues like this.

3-part article on Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization over at the

about Poisson algebras and the little disks operad.   Here's what

<p>
I don't understand this stuff very well!  

<p>
More precisely:

<p>
If you take the space of multivector fields V on a manifold M, and 
think of V equipped with its wedge product and <a href = "http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~pwit/TOK/sem4/online/node9.html">Schouten bracket</a>, you get the easiest example of a <a href = "http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/infinitely_categorified_calcul.html">Gerstenhaber algebra</a>.  

<p>
A Gerstenhaber algebra is an associative supercommutative graded algebra A 
together with a bracket of degree -1 which makes A into a kind of &quot;graded 
Poisson algebra with bracket of degree -1&quot;.  All the usual 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_algebra">Poisson 
algebra</a> axioms hold, but sprinkled with minus signs according to the 
usual conventions.

<p>
If your manifold M is a Poisson manifold, then the space V of multivector 
fields comes equipped with a differential given by taking the Schouten 
bracket with the Poisson bivector field &Pi; in V.  

<p>
Axiomatizing this mess, we get the definition of a Batalin-Vilkovisky 
algebra: a Gerstenhaber algebra with differential that's compatible with 
the other structure in a certain way.

<p>
There are also lots of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras that don't come from 
Poisson manifolds.  But just like Poisson manifolds, we can still think of 
these as describing phase spaces in classical mechanics - in a clever 
algebraic way.  And, that's what BV quantization is all about: figuring 
out how to treat these Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras as classical phase 
spaces and quantize them!

<p>
All this makes some sense to me.  But then it gets weird and mystical...

<p>
First, thanks to an old result of Fred Cohen, a Gerstenhaber algebra 
is the same as an algebra of the operad H(D) - the homology of the 
little disks operad!  
 
<p>
<img src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/emoticons/sm_confused.gif" alt = ""/>

<p>
Did I just hear some of you say "Huh?" 

<p>
Well, let me sketch what that means.   The little disks operad is a gadget 
with a bunch of n-ary operations corresponding to ways of sticking n 
little disks in a big one.  For each n there's a topological space 
of these n-ary operations.  Taking the homology of this topological space, 
we get a graded vector space.  These are the n-ary operations of the operad 
I'm calling H(D).
 
<p>
While I roughly follow how this works, I don't understand the deep inner 
meaning.  It seems amazing: there's a mystical relation between ways of 
sticking little 2d disks in bigger ones, and operations you can do on 
the space of multivector fields on a manifold!

<p>
I don't know if the connections to 2d topological and conformal field 
theory (described in the articles I cite) actually <i>explain</i> this 
mystical relation, or merely <i>exploit</i> it.

<p>
Now, as I said, a Batalin-Vilovisky algebra is a Gerstenhaber algebra 
with an extra operation.  And, Getzler showed that  this extra operation 
corresponds to our ability to <i>twist</i> a little disk 360<sup>&deg;</sup>.  
(Until we started twisting like this, we could equally have used little
2-cubes.)

<p>
More precisely, Getzler showed that a Batalin--Vilkovisky algebra is the same 
as an algebra of the homology of the <i>framed</i> little discs operad.

<p>
This extra twist of the knife only makes me more curious to know 
what's <i>really going on here</i>.

<p>
Here's a clue that could help.   As I explained to Urs a couple days ago, 
this business of &quot;taking homology&quot; is really some sort of 
procedure for turning weak &infin;-groupoids (i.e. spaces) into stable 
strict &infin;-groupoids (i.e. chain complexes) - followed by taking the 
homology of the chain complex, which in principle loses even <i>more</i> 
information, but doesn't in this particular example.   That suggests 
that these Gerstenhaber (and Batalin-Vilkovisky) algebras are really just 
watered-down chain complex versions of <i>spaces</i> equipped with n-ary 
operations corresponding to ways of sticking n (framed) little disks into 
a big disk.  

<p>
But still: <i>what's really going on?  What do classical phase spaces have 
to do with little 2-dimensional disks???</i>

<p>
As far as I'm concerned, the Rosetta Stone on the third page of Getzler's 
paper only serves to heighten the mystery further!
