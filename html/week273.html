Today I'd like to talk about the history of the Earth, and
then say a bit about locally compact abelian groups.   But 
first, a few more words about Enceladus.

<P>
Last week we visited the geysers of Saturn's moon Enceladus.  
Afterwards, George Musser pointed me to an article on this
subject by Carolyn Porco, leader of the imaging team for the 
Cassini-Huygens mission - the team that's been taking the 
photos I showed you.   It's a great article, leading up to some
intriguing theories about what powers these geysers:

<P>
1) Carolyn Porco, Enceladus: secrets of Saturn's strangest moon,
Scientific American, November 2008, available at 
<a href = "http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=enceladus-secrets">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=enceladus-secrets</a>

<P>
And it's free online! - at least for now.  I've criticized the
Scientific American before here, but if they keep coming out with 
articles like this, I'll change my tune.  For one thing, it's 
well-written:

<blockquote>
   There is obviously a tale writ on the countenance of this 
   little moon that tells of dramatic events in its past, but 
   its present, we were about to find out, is more stunning by far.  
   In its excursion over the outskirts of the south polar terrain, 
   Cassini's dust analyzer picked up tiny particles, apparently 
   coming from the region of the tiger stripes.   Two other 
   instruments detected water vapor, and one of them delivered the 
   signature of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and methane.  Cas­si­ni 
   had passed through a tenuous cloud.

<P>
   What is more, the thermal infrared imager sensed elevated 
   temperatures along the fractures - possibly as high as 180 
   kelvins, well above the 70 kelvins that would be expected 
   from simple heating by sunlight.  These locales pump out an 
   extraordinary 60 watts per square meter, many times more than 
   the 2.5 watts per square meter of heat arising from Yellowstone's 
   geothermal area.  And smaller patches of surface, beyond the 
   resolving power of the infrared instrument, could be even hotter.
</blockquote>

<P>
For another, it tackles a fascinating mystery.  Where does all this 
power come from?  The geysers near the south pole of Enceladus emit 
about 6 gigawatts of heat.  Enceladus is too small to have that much 
radioactive heating at its core - only about 0.3 gigawatts, probably.  
The rest must come from tidal heating.  This happens when stuff 
sloshes back and forth in a changing gravitional field: friction 
converts this motion to heat.  

<P>
So, what causes tides on Enceladus?  It may be important that
Enceladus has a 2:1 resonance with Dione: it orbits Saturn twice for
each orbit of that larger moon.  This sort of resonance is known to
cause tidal heating.  For example, in &quot;<a href =
"week269.html">week269</a>&quot;, I showed you how Jupiter's moon Io is
locked in resonances with Europa and Ganymede.  The resulting tidal
heat powers its mighty volcanos.

<P>
Unfortunately, the resonance with Dione doesn't seem powerful enough 
to produce the heat we see on Enceladus.  Unless something funny is 
going on, there should only be 0.1 gigawatts of tidal heating - not 
nearly enough!  At least that's what Porco estimated in 2006:

<P>
2) Carolyn Porco et al, Cassini observes the active south pole of 
Enceladus, Science 311 (2006), 1393-1401.

<P>
So, we need to dream up a more complicated story.  

<P>
Here's one: there could be a kind of slow cycle where the orbit of 
Enceladus gets more eccentric, tidal heating increases, ice beneath 
its surface melts, more sloshing water causes more tidal heating, and 
then the release of heat energy damps its eccentric orbit, until it 
freezes solid and the whole cycle starts over.  We could be near the 
end of such a cycle right now.  

<P>
Here's another: maybe Enceladus has an sea of liquid water under the 
frozen surface of its south pole.  With enough water sloshing around, 
there could be a lot more tidal heating than you'd naively guess... 
and this heating, in turn, could keep the water liquid.  The fun thing 
about this second scenario is that a permanent liquid ocean on 
Enceladus raises the possibility of life!

<P>
Nobody knows for sure what's going on - but Carolyn Porco examines the 
options in a clear and engaging way.  If you like celestial mechanics,

I wrote about Jack Wisdom's work back in &quot;<a href =

<P>
Next I'd like to give you a quick trip through the Earth's history.
In &quot;<a href = "week196.html">week196</a>&quot; we 
looked back into
the deep past, all the way to the electroweak phase transition 10
picoseconds after the Big Bang.  On the other hand, here:

you can zip forwards into the deep future - for example,
10<sup>19</sup> years from now, when the galaxies boil off, shooting
dead stars into the the vast night.

<P>
But now I'd like to zoom in closer to home and quickly tell the 
history of the Earth, focusing on an aspect you may never have thought 
about.  You see, Kevin Kelly recently pointed me to this fascinating 
paper on &quot;mineral evolution&quot;:

<P>
Ever since it was formed, the number of different minerals on Earth
has kept going up &mdash; and ever since <i>life</i> ran wild, it's soared!
Some examples are obvious: seashells become limestone, which gets squashed
into marble.  Some are less so: for example, there wasn't much <i>clay</i> 
before the advent of life.  

<P>
Here's a timeline loosely taken from this paper:

<ul>
<li>
<b>The era of planetary formation.</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Primary chondrite minerals (&gt; 4.56 billion years ago):
<i>60 species of mineral</i>.

<p>
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrite">Chondrites</a> 
are stony meteorites that formed 
early in the history of the solar system. 
They're made of <a href = 
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrule">chondrules</a> &mdash; 
millimeter-sized spheres
of <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine">olivine</a>,

and other minerals &mdash; together
with nuggets called
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium-aluminium-rich_inclusion">CAIs</a> (calcium-aluminum rich inclusions) and other stuff.
These chondrules began life as molten droplets back when the Sun 
was a <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_Tauri_star">T Tauri

<li>
Aqueous alteration, thermal alteration, and shocks form 
achondrites and iron meteorites (4.56 to 4.55 billion years ago): 
<i>250 species of mineral</i>.

<p>
This is the era when the disk of dust circling the early Sun started
forming lumps.  As these lumps collided, they got bigger and bigger,
eventually forming the asteroids and planets we see today.  Some of
these proto-planets melted, letting heavier metals sink to their core
while lighter material stayed on top.  But then some crashed into each
other, shattering and forming new kinds of meteorites: iron-nickel
meteorites, and stony meteorites called <a href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achondrite">achondrites</a>. Thanks to
radioactive dating of these, scientists claim a shockingly precise
knowledge of when all this happened: sometime between 4.56 and 4.55
billion years ago.

</ul>

<li>
<b>The era of crust and mantle reworking</b>. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Igneous rock evolution (4.55 to 4 billion years ago): <i>350 species
of mineral</i>.

<p>
The Earth's history is divided into four eons:
the 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean">Hadean</a>,
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean">Archean</a>,
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a>,
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic">Phanerozoic</a>.
Back when I was a kid, the Cambrian
era seemed really old - but that's just the start of the current 
eon, when multicellular life emerged: the Phanerozoic.  We're digging
much deeper now: the Phanerozoic will be <i>end</i> of today's story.

The Hadean eon began with a bang: the event that formed the Moon
around 4.55 billion years ago!  What made the moon?  The current most
popular explanation is the &quot;giant impact theory&quot; - sometimes
called the Big Splat Theory.  Dana Mackenzie spends a lot of time
writing about math, but he's also written a book about this:

<P>
6) Dana Mackenzie, The Big Splat, or How Our Moon Came To Be,
Wiley, New York, 2003.

<P>
The idea is that another planet formed in one of the &quot;Lagrange 
points&quot; of Earth's orbit - a stable spot 60 degrees ahead or 
behind the Earth:

<P>
7) John Baez, Lagrange points, 
<a href = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/lagrange.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/lagrange.html</a>

<P>
But when this planet reached about the mass of Mars, it would no 
longer be stable in this location.  So, it gradually drifted toward 
Earth, and eventually smacked right into us!  The impact was incredibly
energetic, melting the Earth's entire crust and outer mantle.  The iron
core of this other planet sank into Earth's core, while about 2% of the 
outer part formed an orbiting ring of debris.  Within a century, about 
half of this ring formed the Moon we know and love.

<P>
It's an amazing story, but most of the evidence seems to support it.
The early Moon is known to have been much closer to Earth than it
is now - it's been receding ever since.  For this and many other 
reasons, the giant impact theory is sufficiently solid that the 
hypothetical doomed planet that hit Earth has a name: Theia!  You 
can even watch a simulation of it hitting Earth, produced by Robin
Canup:

<P>
8) Dana Mackenzie, The Big Splat (animation),
<a href = "http://www.danamackenzie.com/big_splat_animation.htm">http://www.danamackenzie.com/big_splat_animation.htm</a>

<P>
Let me quote Mackenzie on this:

<blockquote>
   The simulation shows the first twenty-four hours after the giant 
   impact.  It begins with Theia about to strike the Earth.  After 
   the impact, one hemisphere of the Earth is sheared off and flung 
   into space.  The remaining part of Earth is very lopsided, and sets
   up a "gravitational torque" on the debris.  This boosts some of 
   the debris into orbit.  (Without such a boost, it would all simply 
   fall back down again.)
<P>
   Within a few hours, the debris has formed an "arm" that smashes 
   spectacularly back into the Earth.  This crash is nearly as 
   explosive as the original impact!  (The second explosion can be 
   seen much more vividly in the video than in the still frames 
   published in my book.)  Notice how the temperature of the Earth 
   has risen, from the blues and greens of the early frames to yellows 
   and reds, indicating more than 2000 degrees Kelvin.  Earth has 
   literally become a blast furnace.

</div>
<P>

<P>
   As the fateful day continues, the debris gets more uniformly 
   distributed in a disk around the Earth.  Notice, though, that 
   this disk is not stable like the rings of Saturn.  It develops 
   shock waves that whirl around the Earth, collecting material 
   into spiral arms.  According to Alastair Cameron, another modeler 
   the giant impact, these spiral arms also play an important role 
   in the development of the Moon, by &quot;siphoning&quot; debris up from  
   lower orbits into higher ones.  Scientists have estimated that a 
   mass at least twice the present mass of the Moon had to be lifted 
   beyond the &quot;Roche limit,&quot; roughly twelve thousand miles or three 
   Earth radii above the surface.  Any debris that does not make it 
   past the Roche limit will be torn apart by tidal forces, and cannot 
   form a permanent moon.
<P>
   This simulation stops after 24 hours, a long time before the disk 
   of debris condenses into our Moon.  The Moon was not formed in a 
   day!  However, it did form much more rapidly than you might expect; 
   current estimates range from 1 to 100 years.  This is astounding, 
   compared to ordinary geological time scales.  An entire new planet 
   was born within the life span of a single human.
</blockquote>

<P>
No rocks on Earth are known to survive from before 4.03 billion years 
ago, so the details of this time period are hotly debated.  However, 
many igneous rocks, especially basalt, must have been formed at this 
time.
<P>

<P>
Even after the surface cooled enough to form a crust, volcanoes 
continued to release steam, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.  This led 
to what is called the Earth's &quot;second atmosphere&quot;.  The &quot;first 
atmosphere&quot; was mainly hydrogen and helium; the second was mainly 
carbon dioxide and water vapor, with some nitrogen but almost no 
oxygen.  This second atmosphere had about 100 times as much gas as 
today's &quot;third atmosphere&quot;!

<P>
As the Earth cooled, oceans formed, and much of the carbon dioxide 
dissolved into the seawater and later precipitated out as carbonates.


<li>
Granitoid formation and the first 
cratons (4 to 3.2 billion years ago): <i>1000 species
of mineral</i>. 

<p>
Between 4 and 3.8 billion years ago there was another scary time: 
the Late Heavy Bombardment.  A lot of large craters on the Moon
date to this period, so probably the Earth, Venus and Mars got hit 
too.  Why so many impacts after a period of relative calm?  One 
theory is that Jupiter and Saturn locked into their current 2:1 
resonance at this time, causing a big shakedown in the asteroid
belt and Kuiper belt.  Wikipedia has a nice quick review of this
and other theories:

<p>
9) Wikipedia, Late heavy bombardment,
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_heavy_bombardment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_heavy_bombardment</a>

<p>
This time also marked the rise of &quot;cratons&quot;.  
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cratons">Cratons</a> are a bit
like small early &quot;plates&quot; in the sense of <a href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics">plate tectonics</a>:
they're ancient 
tightly-knit pieces of the earth's crust and mantle, many of which 
survive today.  While most cratons only finished forming 2.7 billion 
years ago, nearly all started growing earlier, in the Eoarchean era.  

<P>
Cratons are made largely of <a href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite#Mineralogy">granitoids</a>.
Granitoids are more sophisticated igneous rocks than basalt.  Modern
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite">granite</a> is one of
these.  Granite is made in a variety of ways, for example by the
remelting of sedimentary rock.  Early granitoids were probably
simpler.

In the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoarchean">Paleoarchean</a> 
and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoarchean">Mesoarchean</a> eras,
plate tectonics as we know it began.  A key aspect of this process
is the recycling of the Earth's crust through 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction">subduction</a>:

Anoxic biology leading up to photosynthesis (3.9 to 2.5 billion years

<p>
The earliest hints of life include some
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation">banded 
iron formations</a> that date back 3.85 billion years.  The real
fun starts with the rise of photosynthesis leading up to the
Great Oxidation Event about 2.5 billion years ago - more on
that later.  But organisms from
the domain <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archea">Archea</a>
can do well in a wide variety of extreme environments without oxygen,
and as their name suggests, many of these organisms are very ancient.
These organisms gave rise to an active 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_cycle">sulfur cycle</a>
and deposits of sulfate ores starting in the
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoarchean">Paleoarchean</a> era.
They also made the atmosophere increasingly rich in methane throughout
the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoarchean">Mesoarchean</a> 
and

The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean">Archean</a> eon

the <a href = "http://www.astrobio.net/news/article541.html">Great
Oxidation Event</a> 2.5 billion years ago.  In this event, also known
as the <a href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_Catastrophe">Oxygen
Catastrophe</a>, photosynthesis put enough oxygen into the atmosphere
to make it lethal to most organisms of the time.  Luckily evolution
found a way out of this impasse.  The oyxgen-rich atmosphere in turn
led to a wide variety of new minerals.

<li>
The intermediate ocean (1.9 to 1 billion years ago):
<i>over 4000 species of mineral</i>.

<p>
In the <a href =
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoproterozoic">Mesoproterozoic</a>
era, increased oxygen levels in the ocean put an end to many anoxic
life forms.  For example, around 1.85 billion years ago, banded iron
formations suddenly ceased.  The next gigayear was rather static and
dull &mdash; if you're mainly interested in new minerals, that is.
The term &quot;intermediate ocean&quot; means that during this period,
the seawater contained a lot more oxygen than before, but still much
less than today.

<li>
Snowball Earth and the Neoproterozoic oxygenation events (1 to 0.54 billion
years ago): <i>over 4000 species of mineral</i>.

<P>
The 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoproterozoic">Neoproterozoic</a>
era probably saw several
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth">Snowball Earth</a>
events: episodes of runaway glaciation during which most or
all the Earth was covered with ice.  Since ice reflects sunlight, 
making the Earth even colder, it's easy to guess how this runaway 
feedback might happen.  The opposite sort of feedback is happening
now, as melting ice makes the Earth darker and thus even warmer.
The interesting questions are why this instability doesn't keep 
driving the Earth to extreme temperatures one way or another -
and what stopped the Snowball Earth events back then!

<P>
Here's a currently popular answer to the second question.  
Ice sheets slow down the weathering of rock.  Weathering of rock
is one of the main long-term processes that use up atmospheric carbon
dioxide, by converting it into various carbonate minerals.  On the 
other hand, even on an ice-covered Earth, volcanic activity would 
keep putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  So, eventually 
carbon dioxide would build up, and the greenhouse effect would warm 
things up again.  This process might be very dramatic, with perhaps 
as much as 13% of the atmosphere being carbon dioxide (350 times 
what we see today), and temperatures soaring to 50 Celsius!
But the details are still the subject of much controversy.

<P>
At the end of these glacial cycles, it's believed that oxygen 
increased from 2% of the atmosphere to 15%.  (Now it's 21%.)  
This may be why multi-celled oxygen-breathing organisms date 
back to this time.  Others argue that the &quot;freeze-fry&quot; cycle 
imposed tremendous evolutionary pressure on life and led to 
the rise of multicellular organisms.  Both these theories could
be true.

<P>
During the glacial cycles, few new minerals were formed - unless
you count ice.  Afterwards, surface rocks were weathered in new
ways involving oxidation.

<li>
Phanerozoic biomineralization
(0.54 billion years ago to now): <i>over 4300 species of mineral</i>.

<p>
The <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic">Phanerozoic</a> 
eon, beginning with the 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian">Cambrian</a> 
540 million years ago, marks the rise of 
of life as we know it.  During this
time, sea life has given rise to extensive deposits of biominerals
such as <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite">calcite</a>, 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonite">aragonite</a>,

<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylapatite">hydroxylapatite</a>, 
and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal">opal</a>.  
There has also been increased production of 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay">clay</a> and many different
<a href = "http://www.environment.ualberta.ca/SoilsERM/class.html#orders">types
of soil</a>.
</ul>
</ul>

This is the end of our story - but of course the story isn't over.
We're now in the Anthropocene epoch of the Cenozoic era of the
Phanerozoic eon.  New things are happening.  Humans are boosting 
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.   If the temperature rises one
more degree, the Earth's temperature will be the hottest it's been
in 1.35 million years, before the Ice Ages began.  There's no telling
when this trend will stop.  We're filling the oceans and land with  
plastic and other debris.  In millions of years, these may form new 
species of minerals.  Regardless, there will probably still be rocks -
but we'll either be gone or drastically changed.

<P>
Next: Pontryagin duality!  Like last week's math topic, I needed to 
learn more about this for my work on infinite-dimensional 
representations of 2-groups.  And like last week's math topic, it 
involves a lot of analysis.  But it also involves a lot of algebra
and category theory.

<P>
You may know about Fourier series, which lets you take a sufficiently
nice complex-valued function on the circle and write it like this:

<P>
f(x) = &sum;<sub>k</sub> g<sub>k</sub> exp(ikx)

<P>
Here n ranges over all integers, so what you're really doing here 
is taking a function on the circle:

<P>
f: S<sup>1</sup> &rarr; C

<P>
and expressing it in terms of a function on the integers:

<P>
g: Z &rarr; C

<P>
More precisely, any L<sup>2</sup> function on the circle can be expressed this
way for some L<sup>2</sup> function on the integers - and conversely.  In fact,
if we normalize things right, the Fourier series gives a unitary
isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces L<sup>2</sup>(S<sup>1</sup>) and 
L<sup>2</sup>(Z).

<P>
You may also know about the Fourier transform, which lets you take a
sufficiently nice complex-valued function on the real line and 
write it like this:

<P>
f(x) = &int; g(k) exp(ikx) dk

<P>
Here k also ranges over the real line, so what you're really 
doing is taking a function on the line:

<P>
f: R &rarr; C

<P>
and expressing it in terms of another function on the line:

<P>
g: R &rarr; C

<P>
In fact, any L<sup>2</sup> function f: R &rarr; C can be expressed this way
for some L<sup>2</sup> function g: R &rarr; C.  And if we normalize things
right, the Fourier transform is a unitary isomorphism from L<sup>2</sup>(R) 
to itself.

<P>
Pontryagin duality is the grand generalization of these two examples!
Any locally compact Hausdorff abelian group A has a "dual" A*
consisting of all continuous homomorphisms from A to S<sup>1</sup>.
The dual is again a locally compact Hausdorff abelian group - or "LCA
group", for short.  When you take duals twice, you get back where you
started.  And the Fourier transform gives a unitary isomorphism
between the Hilbert spaces L<sup>2</sup>(A) and L<sup>2</sup>(A*).

<P>
It's fun to take the Pontryagin duals of specific groups, or
specific classes of groups, and see what we get.  We've already 
seen that the dual of S<sup>1</sup> is Z, 
the dual of Z is S<sup>1</sup>, and the 
dual of R is R.   More generally the dual of the n-dimensional 
torus is Z<sup>n</sup>, and vice versa, while the dual of R<sup>n</sup> 
is isomorphic
to R<sup>n</sup>.  What can we glean from these examples?

<P>
Well, any discrete abelian group is an LCA group - a good example
is Z<sup>n</sup>.  So is any compact Hausdorff abelian group - a good example
is the n-dimensional torus.   And there's a nice general theorem 
saying that the dual of any group of the first kind is a group of 
the second kind, and vice versa!

<P>
In particular, if we have an abelian group that's both compact
and discrete, its dual must be too.  But the only abelian 
groups like this are the <em>finite</em> abelian groups - products of
finite cyclic groups Z/n.  So, this collection of groups is closed under
Pontryagin duality!

<P>
In fact, it's easy to see that for any finite abelian group,
A* is isomorphic to A.  But not canonically!  To get a canonical
isomorphism we need to take duals twice: for any LCA group,
we get a canonical isomorphism between A and A**.  This should
remind you of duality for finite-dimensional vector spaces - 
another famous collection of LCA groups that's closed under 
Pontryagin duality.
 
<P>
You can take any collection of LCA groups, stare at it through
the looking-glass of Pontryagin duality, and see what it looks
like.  I've mentioned a few examples so far:

<blockquote>
A is <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space">compact</a> 
iff A* is <a href = 
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_group">discrete</a>.

iff A* is <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set">finite</a>.

<P>

<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space)">finite-dimensional vector space</a>.
</blockquote>

<P>
Here are some fancier ones:

<blockquote>
A is <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_(algebra)#Definition">torsion-free</a> and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_group">discrete</a> iff A* is <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space">connected</a> and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space">compact</a>.

<P>
If you know more snappy results like this, tell me!  I'm 
collecting them - they're sort of addictive.

<P>
Because Pontryagin duality turns compact LCA groups into discrete
ones - and vice versa - we can use it to turn some topology questions 
into algebra questions, and vice versa.  After all, a discrete
abelian group has no more structure than an "abstract" abelian
group - one without a topology!   

<P>
Sometimes this change of viewpoint helps, but sometimes it merely 
reveals how hard a problem really is.  

<P>
For example, here's an innocent-sounding question: what are the 
compact path-connected LCA groups?  The obvious example is
the circle.  More generally, we could take any product of
circles - even an <em>infinite</em> product.  Are there any others?

<P>
It turns out that this question cannot be settled by
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory together with the axiom of choice!

<P>
Here's why.  An LCA group is compact and path-connected iff 
its dual is a "Whitehead group".  What's that?  It's an abelian
group A such any short exact sequence of abelian groups like this 
splits:

<P>
0 &rarr; Z &rarr; B &rarr; A &rarr; 0

<P>
where Z is the integers and B is any abelian group.

<P>
We call this sort of short exact sequence an "extension of A by Z".  
So, if you want to show off your sophistication, you can say that A 
is a Whitehead group if "Ext(A,Z) = 0".

<P>
The obvious examples of Whitehead groups are free abelian
groups.  Indeed, these are precisely the guys whose Pontryagin
dual is a product of circles!  So the question is: are there
any others?  Or is every Whitehead group a free abelian group?

<P>
This is a famous old problem, called the Whitehead problem:

<P>
10) Wikipedia, Whitehead problem, 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_problem</a>

<P>
In 1971, the logician Saharon Shelah showed the answer to this
problem was undecidable using the axioms of ZFC!  This was one 
of the first problems mathematicians really cared about that
turned out to be undecidable.

<P>
If you want an easy introduction to Pontryagin duality and the
structure of LCA groups, you can't beat this:

Locally Compact Abelian Groups, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge,

This classic treatment is still great, too:

information:

LCA groups and the Whitehead problem.

I'd like to dedicate this issue of This Week's Finds to my father,
Peter Baez, who died yesterday around midnight at the age of 87.
His health had been failing for a long time, so this did not come
as a shock.  
It's a curious coincidence that I was already writing an issue about 
minerals, since my dad majored in chemistry and returned to school for a 
master's in soil science after serving in the Army in World War II.   
After that he worked in the Blackfeet Nation in Browning Montana, 
riding around in a jeep, digging up soil samples, and testing them back
at the lab for the Army Corps of Engineers.  When he found "medicine 
wheels" - stone circles laid down by the native Americans for ritual 
reasons - he would report them to his friend the archeologist Tom 
Kehoe.  Later he moved to California, became an editor for the Forest 
Service, and met my mother.  

<p>
He got me interested in science at an early age because he was always 
taking me to museums, bringing me books from the public library, and 
so on.  As a little kid, when I spilled something, he'd say "So you don't 
believe in the law of gravity?"  He liked to joke around.  Whenever 
I said an ungrammatical sentence, he'd tease me for it.   
"I'm not that hungry."  "What do you mean?  You're not <i>how</i> hungry?"  

<p>
I learned a lot of math, physics 
and chemistry from his 1947 edition of the CRC Handbook of Chemistry 
and Physics - an edition so old that it listed "mesothorium" among 
the radioactive isotopes.  
He brought home the book "From Frege to G&ouml;del" - a sourcebook in 
mathematical logic - because it was in the math section of the library 
and he misread "G&ouml;del" as "Googol": he knew I liked large numbers!  
I didn't understand much of it, but it had a big effect on me.  

<p> I owe a lot to him.

<b>Addenda:</b>   I thank Michael Barr, Kevin Buzzard and Mike
Stay for some interesting comments.
Mike Stay pointed out an interesting book on how humans may
affect the future of mineral evolution:

<P>
17) Jan Zalasiewicz, The Earth After Us: What Legacy Will Humans Leave 
in the Rocks?, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2009. 

<P>
It's not 2009 yet, but the best books about the future are actually
published in the future.   Here's a quote:

<blockquote>
   The surface of the Earth is no place to preserve deep history. This is
   in spite of - and in large part because of - the many events that
   have taken place on it. The surface of the future Earth, one hundred
   million years now, will not have preserved evidence of contemporary
   human activity. One can be quite categorical about this. Whatever
   arrangement of oceans and continents, or whatever state of cool or
   warmth will exist then, the Earth's surface will have been wiped clean
   of human traces.
<P>
   Thus, one hundred million years from now, nothing will be left of
   our contemporary human empire at the Earth's surface. Our planet is
   too active, its surface too energetic, too abrasive, too corrosive, to
   allow even (say) the Egyptian Pyramids to exist for even a hundredth
   of that time. Leave a building carved out of solid diamond - were it
   even to be as big as the Ritz - exposed to the elements for that long
   and it would be worn away quite inexorably.  
<P>
   So there will be no corroded cities amid the jungle that will,
   then, cover most of the land surface, no skyscraper remains akin to
   some future Angkor Wat for future archaeologists to pore
   over. Structures such as those might survive at the surface for
   thousands of years, but not for many millions.

Kevin Buzzard had some interesting comments on Pontryagin duality
in number theory:

<blockquote>
I don't know any more general theorems of the form "G has X iff its
dual has Y" but, since lecturing on Tate's thesis, I learnt some more
nice examples of Pontrjagin duals.

<p>
As you know well, number theorists like to complete fields with
respect to norms. The rational numbers are too rich to understand
completely, so we choose a norm on them, and then we complete with
respect to that norm, and we get either the reals, or, a couple of
thousand years later, the p-adics. Now a complete field is a much
better gadget to have because there's a chance we'll be able to do
analysis on this field. Indeed, for example, it's possible to set up a
theory of Banach spaces etc for any complete field, and this isn't
just for fun &mdash; e.g. Serre showed in the 1960s how to simplify some of
Dwork's work on zeta functions of hypersurfaces using standard
theorems of analysis of Banach spaces, applied to Banach spaces over
the p-adic numbers, and there are oodles of other examples within
number theory (leading up to an entire "p-adic Langlands programme"
nowadays). But ideally, as well as continuity and differentiation etc,
it's nice to be able to do integration as well, and for that you might
need a measure, like Haar measure for example, and if you want to use
Haar measure then you want your complete field to be locally compact
too.

<p>
Now, perhaps surprisingly, Weil (I think it was Weil; it might have
been earlier though and perhaps I'm doing someone a disservice)
managed to completely classify normed fields which were both complete
and locally compact. They are: the reals and finite field extensions,
the p-adic numbers and finite field extensions, and the fields
F<sub>p</sub>((t)) and finite field extensions.  (Given a complete
normed field, there's a unique extension of the norm to any finite
field extension and the extension is still complete &mdash; for the
same sorts of reasons that there's only one vector space norm on
R<sup>n</sup> up to equivalence and it's complete.)

<p>
Tate in his thesis proves the following result (it's not too hard but
it's crucial for him): if K is a complete locally compact normed field
(considered as a locally compact abelian group under addition), then K
is isomorphic to its own Pontrjagin dual. The isomorphism is
non-canonical because you have to decide where 1 goes, but after
you've made that decision there's a unique natural topological and
algebraic isomorphism.  So R and C are their own Pontrjagin
duals &mdash; but the p-adic numbers are also self-dual in this way.

<p>
One of the reasons (perhaps historically the main reason) that number
theorists are interested in complete fields is that given a more
"global" object, like a number field (a finite extension of the
rationals), one way of understanding it is by understanding its
completions. Before I lectured my class on Tate's thesis, if someone
had asked me to motivate the definition of the adeles, I would have
said that to study a number field k it's easiest to think about it
locally, so we complete with respect to a norm, but we can't choose a
natural norm, so we choose all of them, and then we "multiply them all
together" so we can get to them all at once. This is not really an
ideal answer.

<p>
But here's a completely different way of motivating them. Classically,
people interested in automorphic forms would typically consider
functions on a Lie group G which were invariant, or transformed well,
under a well-chosen discrete subgroup: for example one might want to
consider smooth functions on R satisfying f(x)=f(x+1) &mdash; a very
interesting class of functions &mdash; or perhaps functions on
GL<sub>2</sub>(R) which are invariant under GL<sub>2</sub>(Z) (and now
you're well on the way to inventing/discovering the theory of modular
forms). In fact Z lives in R very nicely:

<p>
0 &rarr; Z &rarr; R&rarr; R/Z &rarr; 0

<p>
and furthermore there's a bit of magic in this picture: it's self-dual
with respect to Pontrjagin duality!

<p>
But Z is awkward. It's not a field. You really begin to see the
awkwardness if you're Hecke in the 1930s trying to figure out what the
correct notion of a Dirichlet character is when working with the
integers not of Q but of a finite extension of Q. The problem is that
the integers in a general number field aren't a principal ideal domain
so it's sometimes hard to get your hands on "local information": prime
ideals aren't in general principal so you can't always evaluate a
global object at one <i>number</i> (analogous to the prime number p) to get
local information.

<p>
So let's try and fix this up. Let k be a number field. k is definitely
a global object, like Z, and it's also much easier to manage &mdash;
it's a field rather than just a ring. The question is: what is the
analogue of

<p>
0 &rarr; Z &rarr; R &rarr; R/Z &rarr; 0

<p>
if we replace Z by k, a number field? (Let's give k the discrete
topology, because it has no natural topology other than this.)  Even
replacing Z by the rationals Q (with the discrete topology) is an
interesting question! "Z is to R as Q is to...what?".

<p>
Well, Tate proposes the following: Z is to R as Q is to the adeles of
Q! More generally Z is to R as k (a number field) is to its
adeles. And the argument he could use to justify this isn't
number-theoretic at all, in some sense &mdash; it's coming entirely
from Pontrjagin duality! Tate shows that the Pontrjagin dual of a
number field k is A<sub>k</sub>/k, where A<sub>k</sub> is the adeles
of k, and k is embedded diagonally! Now the analogue of the beautiful
self-dual picture 0 &rarr; Z &rarr; R &rarr; R/Z &rarr; 0 is going to be

<p>
0 &rarr; k &rarr; ??? &rarr; A<sub>k</sub>/k &rarr; 0

<p>
and the natural candidate for ???  is of course now the adeles
A<sub>k</sub>. These gadgets have appeared "magically" in some sense
&mdash; the argument seems to me to be topological rather than
arithmetic (although of course there is more than one choice for ???
and perhaps the argument that the adeles are the right thing to put in
the middle is number-theoretic).

<p>
Here's Tate's proof. Pontrjagin duality sends direct sums to direct
products and vice-versa. So neither of them in particularly
"symmetric" &mdash; both get changed. But Tate observes that
<i>restricted</i> direct products get sent to restricted direct products!
Let k be a number field. Let k<sub>v</sub> denote a typical completion
of k (so if k=Q then k<sub>v</sub> is either R or Q<sub>p</sub>). We know
k<sub>v</sub> is complete and it's easy to check it's locally compact
(this doesn't use Weil's classification &mdash; it's the easy way
around). So k<sub>v</sub> is self-dual. So the restricted product of
all the k<sub>v</sub> (that is, the adeles), is locally compact, and
dual to the restricted product of all the (k<sub>v</sub>)*, and
(k<sub>v</sub>)* is k<sub>v</sub> again, so the adeles of k are
self-dual!! Tate then checks that k (embedded diagonally in
A<sub>k</sub>) is discrete and equal to its own annihilator (if you
choose all the local isomorphisms k<sub>v</sub>=(k<sub>v</sub>)* just
right), and hence by the "Galois correspondence" between closed
subgroups of G and closed subgroups of G* he deduces that
A<sub>k</sub>/k is the dual of k. In particular

<p>
0 &rarr; k &rarr; A<sub>k</sub> &rarr; A<sub>k</sub>/k &rarr; 0

<p>
looks like a very natural analogue of 0 &rarr; Z &rarr; R &rarr; R/Z
&rarr; 0; the quotient is compact, the sub is discrete, and the
diagram is self-Pontjragin-dual.

<p>
Within about 10 years of Tate's thesis it's visibly clear in the
literature that there has been a seismic shift: there seem to be as
many people studying G(Q) \ G(adeles) as there are studying G(Z) \
G(R) in the theory of automorphic forms, and the adelic approach has
the advantage that, although less concrete, it has "truly local"
components, thus motivating the representation theory of p-adic
groups, the Langlands programme, and lots of other things.
