<P>
At the 13th International Congress on Mathematical Physics, held
at Imperial College in London, I was suprised at how much energy 
was focussed on quantum computation and quantum cryptography.  
But it makes perfect sense - this is one area where fundamental 
physics still has the potential to drastically affect everyday life.  
I'm not sure quantum computation will ever be practical, but it's 
certainly worth checking out.  Quantum cryptography is well on its 
way - though people are busy arguing just <em>how</em> practical it will be:

<P>
1) Hoi-Kwong Lo, Will quantum cryptography ever become a successful 
technology in the marketplace?, preprint available as <A HREF = 
"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9912011">quant-ph/9912011</A>

<P>
It seems that both quantum computation and quantum cryptography are
becoming part of a bigger subject, perhaps called &quot;quantum information 
theory&quot; - the study of how information can be transmitted and manipulated
in the context of quantum theory.  There's certainly a need for good 
theorems and definitions in this subject, as well as more experiments.  
For example, nobody seems sure how to calculate the information capacity 
of a quantum channel - or even how to define it!   

<P>
If you're interested in this, it might be good to start with John 
Preskill's lecture notes, which are available for free on the web:

<P>
There was also a lot of stuff about quantum gravity and string theory
at the ICMP.  I especially enjoyed Robert Dijkgraaf's talk, for example.  
Not just the cute animated movies of strings and D-branes, but the highly 
n-categorical flavor of the whole thing - he even presented a picture
proof the Atiyah-Singer index theorem!   It wasn't clear how relevant
this is to the physics of our particular universe, but at the end 
of the talk Dijkgraaf urged us not to worry about that too much: after 
all, the math is so pretty in its own right.   Insofar as I'm a physicist 
this makes me unhappy - but in my other persona, as a mathematician, it
makes sense.

<P>
I prefer to stay one or two trends behind the times when it comes to
string theory, since I'm not actually working on the subject - so it's
easier for me to learn about stuff after it's been prettied up a bit 
by the mathematicians.  Dijkgraaf's talk made me feel a vague 
responsibility to tell you all about what's been going on lately in
string theory.... but I'm not really up on this stuff, so I will
discharge this duty in the laziest manner possible, by listing the 
10 papers most cited by preprints on hep-th during the year 1999.   

<P>
Here they are, from the top-cited one on down:

<P>
3) Juan Maldacena, The large N limit of superconformal field theories
and supergravity, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 2 (1998) 231-252, preprint
available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9711200">hep-th/9711200</A>.  

<P>
This one launched the &quot;AdS-CFT&quot; craze, by pointing out an interesting
relation between supergravity on anti-DeSitter spacetime and conformal
field theories on its &quot;boundary at infinity&quot;.

<P>
4) Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten, Electric-magnetic duality, monopole
condensation, and confinement in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory,
Nucl. Phys. B426 (1994) 19-52, preprint available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9407087">hep-th/9407087</A>.

<P>
This one is ancient history by now, but it's still near the top of the
list!  For mathematicians, this paper marked the birth of Seiberg-Witten 
theory as a substitute for Donaldson theory when it comes to the study 
of 4-dimensional smooth manifolds.  (See &quot;<A HREF = "week44.html">week44</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF = "week45.html">week45</A>&quot;.)  But 
for physicists, it highlighted the growing importance of &quot;dualities&quot; 
relating seemingly different physical theories - of which the AdS-CFT
craze is a more recent outgrowth.

<P>
5) Edward Witten, String theory dynamics in various dimensions, 
Nucl. Phys. B443 (1995) 85-126, preprint available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9503124">hep-th/9503124</A>.

<P> This paper was also important in the quest to understand dualities:
among other things, it argued that the type IIA superstring in 10
dimensions is related to 11-dimensional supergravity - reduced to 10
dimensions by curling up one dimension into a very <em>large</em> circle.  And
as I described in &quot;<A HREF = "week118.html">week118</A>&quot;, this
helped lead to the search for &quot;M-theory&quot;, of which
11-dimensional supergravity is hoped to be a low-energy limit.

<P>
6) Edward Witten, Anti-DeSitter space and holography, Adv. Theor.
Math. Phys. 2 (1998) 253-291, preprint available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9802150">hep-th/9802150</A>.

<P>
More on the AdS-CFT business.

<P>
Still more on the AdS-CFT business.

<P>
8) Joseph Polchinski, Dirichlet branes and Ramond-Ramond charges,

<A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9510017">hep-th/9510017</A>.

<P>
This helped launch the D-brane revolution: the realization that when
we take nonperturbative effects into account, open strings seem to
have their ends &quot;stuck&quot; on higher-dimensional surfaces called D-branes.

<P>
9) Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten, Monopoles, duality and chiral
symmetry breaking in N=2 supersymmetric QCD, Nucl. Phys. B431 (1994)

<P>
More on what's now called Seiberg-Witten theory.

<P>
This was an attempt to given an explicit formulation for M-theory
in terms of a matrix model.

<P>
More about dualities, obviously!  (But also some stuff about the exceptional
Lie group E7, which is bound to tickle the fancy of any exceptionologist.)

<P>
More on D-branes.

<P>
By the way: if you do physics, you can look up your <em>own</em> top cited 
papers on the SPIRES database, at least if someone has cited you 50
or more times:

<P>
This will allow you to measure your fame in milliwittens.

<P>
And now for something completely different:

<P>
I've been thinking about Clifford algebras a lot recently, because I'm
writing a review article on the octonions and exceptional Lie groups, and
a good way to undestand this stuff is to use a lot of Clifford algebras
machinery.  I talked about Clifford algebras in &quot;<A HREF = "week82.html">week82</A>&quot;, &quot;<A HREF = "week93.html">week93</A>&quot;,
and &quot;<A HREF = "week105.html">week105</A>&quot;, but here are some more nice books about them.

<P>
First, when I was giving a little talk on Clifford algebras at Nottingham
University after the ICMP, I needed to look up a few things, and I bumped 
into this book:

<P>
14) P. Budinich and A. Trautman, The Spinorial Chessboard, Springer-Verlag, 
Berlin, 1988.  

<P>
Unfortunately it's out of print, but John Barrett happened to have a
copy.  Springer should reprint it!  It has a nice discussion of the
&quot;Clifford algebra clock&quot;:

                        
<PRE>
                              R

                     R+R              C



                    R                     H
 


                      C              H+H

                               H

</PRE>
As I explained in &quot;<A HREF = "week105.html">week105</A>&quot;, this clock easily lets you remember 
the real Clifford algebras in every dimension and signature of 
spacetime.  Bott periodicity explains why it loops around after
8 hours.  The spinorial chessboard presents the same information
in the form of an 8 x 8 grid.  I won't draw it here, but it's a
picture of the Clifford algebras with p roots of -1 and q roots
of 1 for p,q = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  The black squares correspond to 
cases that admit chiral spinors; the red ones correspond to cases
that don't.  Black is when p+q is even; red is when it's odd.

<P>
By the way, I have a little question: why does the above clock have 
a reflection symmetry along the line joining R+R and H+H?

<P>
Later, by coincidence, when I was in the library I discovered that
Chevalley's work on spinors has been reprinted:

<P>
15) Claude Chevalley, The Algebraic Theory of Spinors, Springer,
Berlin, 1991.

<P>
It has a lot of neat stuff on &quot;pure spinors&quot;, which are
closely related to the &quot;simple bivectors&quot; that describe
2-planes in n-space.  The latter play an important role in spin foam
models of quantum gravity, so I bet pure spinors will too.

<P>
Here's another fundamental text, which really helped get the whole
subject going:

<P>
16) Eli Cartan, The Theory of Spinors, Dover Press, 1966.

<P>
While I'm at it, I should mention this book by the infamous Pertti Lounesto,
which is also good:

<P>
17) Pertti Lounesto, Clifford Algebras and Spinors, Cambridge U. Press, 
Cambridge, 1997.

<P>
I also saw this book at a book fair:

<P>
18) Dominic Joyce, Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy, Oxford
U. Press, Oxford, 2000.

<P>
There's some incredible stuff here about 7-dimensional Riemannian
manifolds whose holonomy groups lie in the exceptional Lie group G2.  I
bet this stuff is gonna be important in string theory someday - if it
isn't already.  After all, G2 is the automorphism group of the
octonions, and it has a 7-dimensional irreducible representation on the
imaginary octonions; as explained in &quot;<A HREF =
"week104.html">week104</A>&quot; by Robert Helling, the octonions are
secretly what let you write down the superstring Lagrangian in 10d
spacetime.

<P>

Footnote: 
<P>
Andrzej Trautman answered my question about reflection symmetry in the 
Clifford algebra clock by noting that
<P>
Cliff(p,q) tensor R(2) = Cliff(q+2,p)
<P>
where R(2) is the algebra of 2x2 real matrices.
A proof of this (actually well-known) fact appears in (7.8b) of his book.
<P>
In response to my list of most-cited papers, Aaron Bergman suggested the 
following 261-page review article on the AdS-CFT correspondence:

Finally, it turns out that manifolds with G2 holonomy <em>are</em> important in 
superstring theory, where they go by the name of "Joyce manifolds".
Here are some places to read about them:

<P>
I learned this thanks to Allen Knutson and Paul Schocklee.  Paul
also had the following interesting comments:

<PRE>
John Baez wrote:

They are important!

If you want to directly compactify 11-dimensional supergravity/M-theory 
to a theory with N=1 supersymmetry in 4 dimensions, which is what people 
like for phenomenological reasons, you need a 7-dimensional manifold
of G2 holonomy (just as you need manifolds of SU(3) holonomy, i.e.
Calabi-Yau manifolds, in six dimensions).  I have seen these referred 
to as "Joyce manifolds," after Dominic Joyce, who constructed several 
examples of such spaces.  (I didn't know there was so much known about
them.  I'll have to check out the above book; I see that our library 
in Iceland has a copy.)

Unfortunately, these models are afflicted by the usual problem of
11-d SUGRA compactifications, which is that they are non-chiral,
so these days people seem to be concentrating more on Horava-Witten
compactifications, with M-theory on S<sup>1</sup>/Z<sub>2</sub> times a Calabi-Yau, or on
an orbifold. 

If you're interested, you might want to check out Papadopoulos and Townsend,
"Compactification of D=11 supergravity on spaces of exceptional holonomy,"
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/9506150.
