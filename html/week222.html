<P>
Last week there was a big conference on quantum gravity at
the Albert Einstein Institute near Berlin:

<P>
1) Loops '05, 
<A HREF = "http://loops05.aei.mpg.de">http://loops05.aei.mpg.de</A>

<P>
The focus was loop quantum gravity and spin foams, but there 
were also talks about other approaches, so it was much bigger than
last year's get-together in Marseille.  Last year about 100 people
attended; this time about 160 did!  It was strange seeing old pals 
like Ashtekar, Lewandowski, Loll, Rovelli and Smolin almost lost 
in a sea of new faces.  But, it was great to talk to everyone, 
both old and new.

<P>
I'll say more about this conference, but first let's talk about 
&gamma; ray bursters, a black hole without a host galaxy, the newly 
discovered moon of planet Xena, and lots of other transneptunian 
objects.

<P>
Actually, just for fun, let's start with this science fiction novel
I picked up in Heathrow en route to Berlin:

<P>
This is one of the few tales I've read that does a good job of 
fleshing out Verner Vinge's &quot;Singularity&quot; scenario, where the 
accelerating development of technology soars past human 
comprehension and undergoes a phase transition to a thoroughly 
different world.   This is a real possibility, and it's been 
discussed a lot:

<P>
However, it's not an easy subject for fiction - at least not for 
mere human readers!  Stross makes it gripping: sometimes goofy, sometimes
thrilling, and sometimes rather sad.  Characters include a robot cat
with ever-growing powers and some space-faring uploaded lobsters.  

<P>
The hero, Manfred Macx, starts out as a freeware developer, futurist 
and all-purpose wheeler-dealer.  Here's a scene from the beginning
of the book, before all hell breaks loose:

<blockquote>
     Manfred's mood of dynamic optimism is gone, broken by the 
     knowledge that his vivisectionist stalker has followed him 
     to Amsterdam  to say nothing of Pamela, his dominatrix, 
     source of so much yearning and so many morning-after weals. 
     He slips his glasses on, takes the universe off hold, and 
     tells it to take him for a long walk while he catches up on 
     the latest on the tensor-mode gravitational waves in the 
     cosmic background radiation (which, it is theorized, may be 
     waste heat generated by irreversible computational processes 
     back during the inflationary epoch; the present-day universe 
     being merely the data left behind by a really huge calculation). 
     And then there's the weirdness beyond M31: according to the 
     more conservative cosmologists, an alien superpower - maybe 
     a collective of Kardashev Type Three galaxy-spanning 
     civilizations - is running a timing channel attack on the 
     computational ultrastructure of space-time itself, trying to 
     break through to whatever's underneath.  The tofu-Alzheimer's 
     link can wait.
</blockquote>

An idea a minute - and the book is free online: what more could you 
want?  

<P>
But right now, the big news in astronomy is <em>not</em> about a type III 
civilization lurking beyond M31 (otherwise known as the Andromeda
Galaxy).  It's some evidence that short &gamma; ray bursts are caused 
by collisions involving neutron stars and black holes!

<P>
&Gamma; ray bursts are among the most energetic events known in the
heavens.   They happen in galaxies throughout the universe; we see 
about one a day, and each releases somewhere between 10<sup>45</sup> and 
10<sup>47</sup> joules of energy.  The larger figure is what you'd get by 
turning the entire mass of the Sun into energy.  

<P>
There could be several kinds of &gamma; ray bursts, but there seem to
be at least two: short and long.   Short bursts last between 
40 milliseconds and 10 seconds - imagine the whole Sun turning into 
energy that fast!  Long ones last between 10 and 100 seconds.  The
two kinds seem to be qualitatively different: for example, the short 
ones consist of higher-frequency &gamma; rays.  The big news is that 
they happen in different kinds of galaxies!

<P>
In &quot;<A HREF = "week204.html">week204</A>&quot;, I described how 
people caught a long &gamma; ray burst 
in the act in March 2003.  A &gamma; ray detector aboard a satellite 
relayed information to telescopes in Australia and Japan, allowing 
them to spot a visible afterglow right after the burst.  The details 
of this glow fit the &quot;hypernova&quot; theory of long &gamma; ray bursts.

<P>
The hypernova theory says that when a star more than 25 times heavier
than the Sun runs out of fuel and collapses, it forms a black hole 
that sucks down the star's iron core before a normal supernova 
explosion can occur.  In just a few seconds, about a solar mass of 
iron spirals into the black hole, forming a pancake-shaped disk as 
it goes down.  In the process, this disk becomes incredibly hot and 
shoots out jets of radiation in the transverse directions.  As they 
plow through the star's outer layers, these jets create beams of 
&gamma; rays.  

<P>
The short bursts have been harder to catch.  By the time a telescope 
on Earth could be aimed at the spot where the &gamma; rays were seen, 
no afterglow could be seen!

<P>
So, in October 2004 NASA launched Swift: a &gamma;-ray detecting 
satellite equipped with an X-ray telescope and an ultraviolet/optical 
telescope that can respond quickly whenever a burst is
seen:

<P>
On May 9th, 2005, Swift detected a short burst and caught 11 photons 
of the burst's X-ray afterglow.  Another short burst detected by 
HETE-II had its X-ray afterglow caught by the Chandra X-ray satellite.  
Analysis of these and two more short bursts has convinced some 
scientists that they're caused by collisions between neutron stars 
and/or black holes:

short-hard &gamma;-ray bursts, Nature 437 (October 2005), 849-850.
Also available at <A HREF = "http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/135397main_nature_fox_final.pdf">http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/135397main_nature_fox_final.pdf</A>

<P>
Despite what the news media are saying, I don't see that this paper 
&quot;proves&quot; the short &gamma;-ray bursts are caused by such collisions.  
Instead, I see some good pieces of evidence.  

<P>
The faintness of the afterglows suggests some mechanism other than a 
hypernova.  But as far as I can tell, the best evidence is that short
&gamma; ray bursts tend to happen near the edges of old galaxies, while 
the long ones happen near the centers of young galaxies.  

<P>
The center of a young galaxy is where you'd expect to find a really 
huge Wolf-Rayet star, the sort that dies in a hypernova.  The edge of 
an old galaxy is where you'd expect to see black holes and neutron 
stars collide.  Why?  Because such collisions can only happen long 
after stars are first formed.  First you need an orbiting pair of 
giant stars to go supernova and collapse into neutron stars and/or 
black holes.  Then you need plenty more time for this pair to spiral 
down thanks to gravitational radiation, and eventually collide.
By then the pair may sail off to the edge of the galaxy, thanks to 
the &quot;kick&quot; delivered by the supernova explosions. 

<P>
I hope astronomers can clinch the case for the collision theory of
short &gamma; ray bursts.  After all, these collisions involving 
neutron stars and black holes are precisely what gravitational wave 
detectors like LIGO and VIRGO are hoping to see!  If we know to look 
for gravitational waves precisely when we see short &gamma; ray bursts, 
and we know where they're coming from, we'll have a better chance of 
finding them.

<P>
(Of course, we'll also have a better chance of <em>fooling</em> ourselves
into <em>thinking</em> we found them, until we do some double-blind tests.)

<P>
By the way, LIGO is already analysing data to look for gravitational
waves.  I talked about this in 
&quot;<A HREF = "week189.html">week189</A>&quot;, but here's something new:
now you can help them by running a cool screensaver called 
Einstein@Home on your computer!  Check it out:

Speaking of black holes, last month the Hubble Space Telescope and
the Very Large Telescope in Chile detected a quasar that seems
to have no host galaxy:

<P>
Quasars are thought to be super massive black holes; they're usually 
found in the centers of galaxies, where they devour stars and shoot 
out enormously powerful jets of radiation.  However, the quasar 
HE0450-2958 is surrounded only by a blob of ionized gas.  Nearby, a
wildly disturbed spiral galaxy can be seen.  

<P>
Compare HE0450-2958 (at left) with a normal quasar (at right):

The quasar HE0450-2958 is in the middle of the left-hand picture;
the disturbed galaxy is above and a completely irrelevant foreground
star is below.  For more details on what this image means, click on it.

<P>
Did this quasar begin 
life in the middle of a galaxy and then get kicked out when that 
galaxy collided 
with something containing a super-massive black hole?  What could that
something be?

Closer to home, astronomers at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii have 
discovered that planet Xena has a moon!

<P>
If you hadn't heard about planet Xena, or you don't like the idea 
of naming a planet after a TV character - even a &quot;warrior princess&quot; - 
don't get worked up just yet.  Xena's official name is currently 
2003 UB<sub>313</sub>, and though she's larger than Pluto, the International 
Astronomical Union has not decided whether she'll officially be 
considered a planet.  

<P>
If Xena becomes a planet, she'll probably be renamed Persephone, 
after the reluctant queen of the underworld in Greek mythology.  
But, she may have to settle for the status of a mere &quot;transneptunian 
object&quot;, like Quaoar and Sedna.  Indeed, if Pluto had been discovered
more recently, folks probably wouldn't have called him a planet 
either.

<P>
If you haven't even heard of Quaoar and Sedna... well, you must be
too absorbed by mundane concerns to keep track of the burgeoning
population of our Solar System.  But it's not too late to mend your
ways!  Impress your friends by casually dropping some of this jargon:

   This is the region in the ecliptic (the plane of the planets' orbits) 
   between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun.  There are a bunch of planetoids
   in this belt.  Beyond 50 AU there seems to be a sharp dropoff in

    Folks believe Quaoar is a mixture of ice and rock.  
    It's very dark in color, but last year crystalline water ice was 
    detected on its surface, using infrared spectroscopy.   This came 
    as a surprise, because cosmic rays and solar wind should convert 
    exposed ice crystals to the amorphous form of ice within about 
    10 million years.  Could there have been liquid water volcanos 
    active on Quaoar this recently??  Or maybe meteor impacts melt 
    amorphous ice and then it crystallizes?

    <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto">Pluto</A> itself, 
    though some pedants argue 
    that Pluto can't be a &quot;little Pluto&quot;.  Pluto is quite different 
    than anything else we call a planet: it has an eccentric orbit that 
    ranges between 30 and 50 AU, and its orbit is tilted 17 degrees to
    the ecliptic.  Its surface is light brown, consisting mainly of 
    frozen nitrogen and carbon monoxide.  When it comes near the sun,

   It's redder than Mars, its temperature never rises above 23 Kelvin,
   and its year lasts 11,250 years.  It's
   the farthest known object in our Solar System, but still much closer
   than the Oort cloud was supposed to be.  Maybe it's a drastic example
   of a scattered disc object, maybe it's part of an &quot;inner Oort 
   cloud&quot;... or maybe the Oort cloud isn't as far out as people thought.

<P>
First, there's new evidence that a quantum theory of pure gravity
(meaning gravity without matter) makes sense in 4-dimensional spacetime.  

<P>
To understand why this is exciting, you have to realize that in some 
quarters, the conventional wisdom says a quantum theory of pure gravity
can't possibly make sense, except as a crude approximation at large
distance scales, because this theory is &quot;perturbatively 
nonrenormalizable&quot;.

<P>
Very roughly, this means that as we zoom in and look at the theory at
shorter and shorter distance scales, it looks less and less like a 
&quot;free field theory&quot; where gravitons zip about without interacting.   
Instead, the interactions get stronger and more complicated!  

<P>
So, in the jargon of the trade, we don't get a &quot;Gaussian ultraviolet 
fixed point&quot;.   

<P>
Huh?

<P>
Well, roughly, an &quot;ultraviolet fixed point&quot; is a quantum field theory
that keeps looking the same as you keep viewing it on shorter and
shorter distance scales.  A &quot;Gaussian&quot; ultraviolet fixed point is one
that's also a free quantum field theory: one where particles don't 
interact.  

<P>
If quantum gravity approached a Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point as 
we zoomed in, we could calculate what gravitons do at arbitrarily 
high energies (at least perturbatively, as power series in Newton's 
constant - no guarantee that these series converge).  Particle 
physicists would then be happy and say the theory was &quot;perturbatively 
renormalizable&quot;.  

<P>
But, it's not.

<P>
The conventional wisdom concludes that to save quantum gravity, we 
must include matter of precisely the right sort to <em>make</em> it 
perturbatively renormalizable.  This is the quest that led people 
first to supergravity and ultimately to superstring theory - see
&quot;<A HREF = "week195.html">week195</A>&quot; for more of this story.

<P>
But, as far back as 1979, the particle physicist Weinberg raised the 
possibility that pure quantum gravity is &quot;nonperturbatively 
renormalizable&quot;, or &quot;asymptotically safe&quot;.  This means that 
as we 
zoom in and look at the theory at shorter and shorter distance scales, 
it approaches some theory <em>other than</em> that of noninteracting gravitons.

<P>
In other words, Weinberg was suggesting that pure quantum gravity 
approaches a non-obvious ultraviolet fixed point - possibly a 
&quot;non-Gaussian&quot; one.  

<P>
The big news is that this seems to be true!  

<P>
Even cooler, in this theory spacetime seems to act <em>2-dimensional</em>
at very short distance scales.  

<P>
This idea has been brewing for a long time - I talked about it 
extensively back in &quot;<A HREF = "week139.html">week139</A>&quot;.  
But now there's more solid 
evidence for it, coming from two quite different approaches.

<P>
First, people doing numerical quantum gravity in the &quot;causal dynamical 
triangulations&quot; approach are seeing this effect in their computer 
calculations.  This is what Renate Loll explained at Loops '05.  The 
best place to read the details is here:

<P>
19) Jan Ambj&oslash;rn, J. Jurkiewicz and Renate Loll, Reconstructing 
the universe, Phys. Rev. D72 (2005) 064014.  Also available as
<A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0505154">hep-th/0505154</A>.

<P>
but if you need something less technical, try this:

scratch, available as 
<A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0509010">hep-th/0509010</A>.

<P>
The titles of their papers are a bit grandiose, but their calculations 
are solid stuff - truly magnificent.  I described their basic strategy
in my report on the Marseille conference in 
<A HREF = "week206.html">week206</A>.  So, I won't explain that again.
I'll just mention their big new result: in pure 
quantum gravity, spacetime has a spectral dimension of 4.02 
&plusmn; 0.1 on large distance scales, but 1.80 &plusmn; 0.25 in the 
limit of very short distance scales! 

<P>
Zounds!  What does that mean?
<P>
The &quot;spectral dimension&quot; of a spacetime is the dimension as measured 
by watching heat spread out on this spacetime: the short-time behavior of 
the heat equation probes the spacetime at short distance scales, while its 
large-time behavior probes large distance scales.  Spectral dimensions
don't need to be integers - for fractals they're typically not.  But,
Loll and company believe they're seeing spacetimes that are <em>exactly</em>
2-dimensional in the limit of very small distance scales, 
<em>exactly</em> 4-dimensional in the limit of very large scales, 
with a continuous change in dimension in between.   The error bars in 
the above figures come from doing Monte Carlo simulations.  They're 
just using ordinary computers, not supercomputers.  So, with 
more work one could shrink their error bars and test their result.

<P>
My main worry about their work is that it uses a fixed slicing of
spactime by timelike slices.  So, there's a danger that their 
procedure breaks Lorentz-invariance, even in the continuum limit 
which they are attempting to compute.   I would like to find a way
around this problem!

<P>
Luckily, some other people are getting similar results from a second
procedure that definitely does <em>not</em> break Lorentz invariance:

<P>

asymptotically safe gravity, available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0508202">hep-th/0508202</A>.

<P>
Reuter spoke about all this work at Loops '05.  The idea is to 
investigate Weinberg's original idea in excruciatingly precise
detail using &quot;renormalization group flow&quot; ideas.  The above paper 
is a review of lots of others, and you need to read a bunch to get 
what's really going on.  The upshot, however, is that they find 
evidence for a non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point in pure quantum
gravity.  Moreover, the spectral dimension of spacetime approaches
2 in the limit of very short distance scales.  

<P>
Suppose this is all true.  What does it mean?

<P>
Nobody knows yet; there are lots of attitudes one could take.

<P>
Ambj&oslash;rn, Jurkiewicz and Loll could probably just plunge ahead and
use computers to calculate lots of things about quantum gravity.
(Right now they want to test their results in lots of ways.)  One
good thing would be to include matter of various sorts and see how
it affects the conclusions.

<P>
Similarly, Lauscher and Reuter could just plunge ahead and compute,
if they wanted.

<P>
This is excellent.  But personally, I'd like to find a beautiful theory
in which spacetime is 2-dimensional at short distance scales, which
reduces to general relativity at large scales.  In other words, to
redo all these calculations &quot;from the bottom up&quot;.  

<P>
Unsurprisingly, I hope this beautiful theory is a spin foam model, 
since spin foams are 2-dimensional and I like them a lot.  I presented 
some rough ideas on how one might invent such a model:

<P>
22) John Baez, Towards a spin foam model of quantum gravity, 
talk at Loops '05, available at
<A HREF = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/loops05/">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/loops05/</A>

<P>
But, these ideas are very tentative and only time will tell if they amount to
anything.  What's more important is that pure quantum gravity seems
to exist - as a theory, that is - and people seem to be learning
actual facts about it, instead of just arguing endlessly about it.
That's progress!

<P>
The second most exciting thing at Loops '05, in my biased opinion,
was the work of John Barrett, Laurent Freidel, Karim Noui and others 
on &quot;matter without matter&quot; in 3d quantum gravity.  Simply by carving a 
Feynman-diagram-shaped hole in 3d spacetime and doing quantum gravity
on the spacetime that's left over, you get a good theory of quantum
gravity coupled to matter!  You can even take the limit as Newton's
gravitational constant goes to zero and get ordinary quantum field
theory on flat spacetime!

This is mindblowingly beautiful, especially because lots of it is 
already mathematically rigorous, and we can easily make more so.  
It's even related to n-categories: my student Jeffrey Morton
presented a poster on this aspect.  

<P>
Together with my student Derek Wise, Jeffrey Morton and I plan to have 
a lot of fun studying this stuff.  So, I won't talk about it more now - 
I'll probably get around to saying more someday, especially about how 
the whole story generalizes to 4 dimensions.

<P>
There's a lot more to say about Loops '05, but this will have to do.
In a while, a bunch of the talks should be visible on the conference 
homepage.... that should give you a better idea of what happened.

<b>Addendum</b>: Here are some comments on this Week's Finds by Gene Partlow,
Phillip Helbig and Robert Helling, and my replies - as well as a replies

Gene Partlow writes: 

<blockquote>
 In a recent John Baez post he mentions discovery of probably the 
 first known quasar found without a host galaxy.  He says: 

<PRE>
    Did this quasar begin life in this galaxy and then get kicked 
    out when the galaxy collided with something containing a 
    super-massive black hole?
</PRE>

 I suggest that a fairly ordinary explanation may be that the
 nearby &quot;wildly disturbed&quot; galaxy may have contained several
 supermassive black holes which interacted via a gravitational
 slingshot scenario.  This would be like a larger version of
 the effect where smaller mass stars can be flung out of globular 
 clusters when encountering larger mass stars near the cluster center.
</blockquote>

Sounds like a possibility worth exploring.  I'm no expert, so
I can't tell how likely this is.  I agree that a collision 
with some other object containing a super-massive black hole 
sounds a little odd, given that this object - most plausibly
another galaxy - has <em>not been seen</em>.  I wouldn't have ventured
such a guess myself.  But, it's mentioned on the European 
Southern Observatory webpage I cite above.  To quote:

<blockquote>
 The absence of a massive host galaxy, combined with the existence 
 of the blob and the star-forming galaxy, lead us to believe that 
 we have uncovered a really exotic quasar, says team member Frederic 
 Courbin (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland). 
 &quot;There is little doubt that a burst in the formation of stars in 
 the companion galaxy and the quasar itself have been ignited by a 
 collision that must haven taken place about 100 million years ago. 
 What happened to the putative quasar host remains unknown.&quot;

<P>
 HE0450-2958 constitutes a challenging case of interpretation. 
 The astronomers propose several possible explanations, that will 
 need to be further investigated and confronted. Has the host galaxy 
 been completely disrupted as a result of the collision? It is hard 
 to imagine how that could happen. Has an isolated black hole captured 
 gas while crossing the disc of a spiral galaxy? This would require 
 very special conditions and would probably not have caused such a 
 tremendous perturbation as is observed in the neighbouring galaxy.

<P>
 Another intriguing hypothesis is that the galaxy harbouring the black 
 hole was almost exclusively made of dark matter. &quot;Whatever the solution 
 of this riddle, the strong observable fact is that the quasar host 
 galaxy, if any, is much too faint&quot;, says team member Knud Jahnke 
 (Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam, Germany).

 Also, for a period of several years during each orbit, it is closer to

Yeah!  The US may still send a mission to Pluto before its atmosphere 
freezes, despite delays and indecision.  The &quot;Pluto Express&quot; 
satellite was scheduled for launch in December 2004, but in 2000 NASA ordered 
a stop-work order on the project, due to lack of money and rising cost 
estimates.  In 2003, Congress gave NASA money to proceed with the project:

 Is there an easy way to see why these resonance orbits come about? Why
 do three body systems with a large central object, an intermediate
 planet and a small probe happen to get the probe in resonance with the
 planet? Is this just &quot;frequency locking happens in chaotic systems&quot;
 or is there an easy but more quantitative way to understand this?

I'm shamefully ignorant of this, so ten minutes' research on the

<P>
and while not easy to understand - I guess there's a huge body of 
work on this subject - it uses Hamiltonian perturbation theory
and continued fractions to study resonance, and talks about a difference 
between &quot;shallow&quot; and &quot;deep&quot; resonances.  

<P>
The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are almost in 5:2 resonance, but 
this is a &quot;shallow&quot; resonance, and Saturn wiggles back and forth 
around this resonance with a period of about 880 years - an effect 
called the &quot;Great Inequality&quot;.  The first person to study this was
Laplace.  I read elsewhere that:

<blockquote>
 The dynamics of the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system was recognized
 as problematic from the beginnings of perturbation theory.  
 The problems are due to the so-called Great Inequality (GI), which
 is the Jupiter-Saturn 2:5 mean-motion near-commensurability.

planetary Hamiltonian theory, available as 
<A HREF = "http://arxiv.org/abs/chao-dyn/9311011">chao-dyn/9311011</A>.

<P>
This shallow 5:2 resonance is related to the continued fraction

<PRE>
1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(14 + 1/(2 + .... ))))
</PRE>
which is close to 2/5.

<P>
The Pluto-Neptune 3:2 resonance, on the other hand, is a 
&quot;deep resonance&quot;
and related to the continued fraction

<PRE>
1/(2 - 1/(2 + 1/(10 + .... )))
</PRE>
which starts out close to 2/3.  

<P>
I wish I understood the connection between continued fractions and
dynamical systems better!  I know it gives rise to the role of the 
Golden Ratio in chaos theory, which I tried to explain in &quot;<A HREF =
"week203.html">week203</A>&quot;.
But, I don't understand it very deeply.

Robert Helling also asked:

<blockquote>
There are people doing numerical long term stability
analysis of the solar system. From what I know, they are not just
taking F=ma and Newton's law of gravity, replacing dt by &Delta;t and
then integrating but use much fancier spectral methods. Could somebody
please point me to an introduction into these methods?

I referred him to the work of Gerald Sussman, Jack Wisdom and others in 
&quot;<A HREF = "week107.html">week107</A>&quot;, but Jonathan Thornburg
posted this reply:

<blockquote>
I don't do this sort of work myself, but the buzzwords you want are
&quot;symplectic ODE integrator&quot;.  
The basic idea is to use an ODE integration
scheme which conserves energy, angular momentum, and maybe other nice
things, up to floating-point roundoff error, rather than just up to
finite differencing error like a standard ODE integrator would do.
