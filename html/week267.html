<P>
After the workshop on categorical groups in Barcelona, I went to
Granada - the world capital of categorical groups!  Pilar Carrasco, 
an expert on this subject, had kindly invited me to spend a week 
there and give some talks.  Even more kindly, she put me in a hotel 
right next to the Alhambra.

<P>

So, this week I'll tell you about some categorical groups I saw in the
Alhambra.

<P>
I've long been fascinated by that melting-pot of cultures in southern
Spain called Andalusia.  I wrote about it back in &quot;<a href =
"week221.html">week221</A>&quot;.  It was invaded by Muslims in 711
AD, and became a center for mathematics and astronomy from around 930
AD to around the 1200s, when the city of Toledo, recaptured by
Catholic Spaniards, became the center of a big translation industry -
translating Arabic and Hebrew texts into Latin.  This was important
for the transmission of ancient Greek writings into Western Europe.

<P>
The Alhambra was built after the true heyday of Andalusia, in the 
era when Muslims had almost been pushed out by the Catholics.  Its 
construction was begun by Muhammed ibn Nasr, founder of the Nasrid
Dynasty - the last Muslim dynasty in Spain.

<P>
In 1236, Ferdinand III of Castile captured the marvelous city of 
Cordoba, &quot;ornament of the world&quot;.  Ibn Nasr saw which way the wind 
was blowing, and arranged to pay tribute to Ferdinand and even help 
him take the city of Seville in return for leaving his city - 
Granada - alone.  He started building the Alhambra in 1238.  It was
completed in the late 1300s.

<P>
For the mathematician, one striking thing about the Alhambra is
the marvelous tile patterns.  On my visit, I took photos of all 
the tiles I could see:

<P>
Some people say that tilings with all 17 possible &quot;wallpaper
groups&quot; as symmetries can be found in the Alhambra.  This article 
rebuts that claim with all the vehemence such an academic issue
deserves, saying that only 13 wallpaper groups are visible:

<P>
Of the remaining four, two seem completely absent in Islamic art
- the groups called &quot;pgg&quot; and &quot;pg&quot;.  Both are
fairly low on symmetries, so they might have been avoided for lack of
visual interest.

<P>
Let me describe them, just for fun.  You can learn the 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Formal_definition_and_discussion">definition</a> of wallpaper groups, and a lot more about them, 
from this rather wonderful article:

<P>
4) Wikipedia, Wallpaper group,
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group</a>

<P>
The group 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_pgg">pgg</a> 
is the symmetry group of this popular zig-zag
method of laying bricks:

<p>
<div align = "center">
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_pgg">
<img border = "2" src = "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Wallpaper_group-pgg-2.jpg/400px-Wallpaper_group-pgg-2.jpg">
</a></div>
<br/>

The only
rotations in this group are 180-degree rotations: you can rotate
any brick 180 degrees around its center, and the pattern comes
back looking the same.  There are no reflections in this group.
But, there are &quot;glide reflections&quot; in two diagonal directions:
a &quot;glide reflection&quot; is a combination of a translation along 
some line and a reflection across that line.  

<P>
The group 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_pg">pg</a>
is a subgroup of pgg.  If we take our zig-zag
pattern of bricks and break the 180-degree rotation symmetry
somehow, the remaining symmetry group is pg:

<p>
<div align = "center">
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_pg">
<img border = "2" src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Wallpaper_group-pg-2.jpg/400px-Wallpaper_group-pg-2.jpg">
</a></div>
<br/>


This group contains no reflections and no rotations.  It contains
translations along one diagonal axis and &quot;glide reflections&quot;
along another.

<P>
For more on tilings, try this book.  Among other things, it points out
that there's a lot more beauty and mathematical structure in tilings
than is captured by their symmetry groups!

<P>
The mathemagician John Horton Conway has come up with a very
nice proof that there are only 17 wallpaper groups.  This is
nicely sketched in the Wikipedia article above, but detailed
here:

6) John H. Conway, The orbifold notation for surface groups, in 
Groups, Combinatorics and Geometry, London Math. Soc. Lecture 
Notes Series 165, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 1990, pp. 438-447

<P>
Here's the basic idea.  Take a wallpaper pattern and count two points
as &quot;the same&quot; if they're related by a symmetry.  In other
words - in math jargon - take the plane and mod out by the wallpaper
group.  The result is a 2-dimensional &quot;orbifold&quot;.

<P>
In a 2d manifold, every point has a little neighborhood that looks
like the plane.  In a 2d orbifold, every point has a little
neighborhood that looks either like the plane, or the plane mod a
finite group of rotations and/or reflections.

<p>
Let's see how this works for a few simple wallpaper groups.

<p>
I'll start with the most boring wallpaper group in the world, <a href
= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_p1">p1</a>.  If
you thought pg was dull, wait until you see p1.  It's the symmetry
group of this wallpaper pattern:

<pre>

   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    

</pre>

This group doesn't contain any rotations, reflections or glide
reflections - I used the letter R to rule those out. 
It only contains translations in two directions, the bare
minimum allowed by the definition of a wallpaper group.

<p>
If we take the plane and mod out by this group, all the
points labelled x get counted as &quot;the same&quot;:

<pre>

   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R   x R   x R   x R   x R   x R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R   x R   x R   x R   x R   x R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    

</pre>

Similarly, all these points labelled y get counted as
&quot;the same&quot;:

<pre>

   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
   R     R     R     R     R     R    
  RRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRRRRyRRR
   R     R     R     R     R     R    

</pre>

So, when we take the plane and mod out by the group p1,
we get a rectangle with its right and left edges glued
together, and with its top and bottom edges glued together.
This is just a torus.  A torus is a 2d manifold, which is
a specially dull case of a 2d orbifold.

<P>
Now let's do a slightly more interesting example:

<pre>

   T     T     T     T     T     T     
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    

</pre>

The letter T is more symmetrical than the letter R:
you can reflect it, and it still
looks the same.  (If you're viewing this using some font
where the letter T <i>doesn't</i> have this symmetry,
switch fonts!)  So, the symmetry group of this wallpaper 
pattern, called <a href = 
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_pm">pm</a>, 
is bigger than p1: it also contains reflections
and glide reflections along a bunch of parallel lines.
So now, all these points labelled x get counted
as the same when we mod out:

<pre>

   T     T     T     T     T     T     
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T x x T x x T x x T x x T x x T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T x x T x x T x x T x x T x x T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    

</pre>

and similarly for all these points labelled y:

<pre>

   T     T     T     T     T     T     
  TTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
  TTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
  TTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTTyTyTTT
   T     T     T     T     T     T    

</pre>

but look how these points labelled z work:

<pre>

   T     T     T     T     T     T     
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T  z  T  z  T  z  T  z  T  z  T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T  z  T  z  T  z  T  z  T  z  T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
   T     T     T     T     T     T    
  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   T  z  T  z  T  z  T  z  T  z  T    

</pre>

There are only half as many z's per rectangle, 
since they lie on reflection lines.

<p>
Because of this subtlety, this time when we mod out
we get an orbifold that's not a manifold!  It's the torus
of the previous example, but now folded in half.  
We can draw it as <i>half</i> of one of the rectangles 
above, with the top and bottom glued together, but not the sides:

<pre>

   TTTT
   T  .
   T  .
   T  .
   TTTT

</pre>
    
So, it's a cylinder... but in a certain technical sense
the points at the ends of this cylinder count as "half points":
they lie on reflection lines, so they've been "folded in half".

<p>
This particular orbifold looks a lot like a 2d manifold "with
boundary".  That's a generalization of a 2d manifold where some 
points - the &quot;boundary&quot; points - have a neighborhood 
that looks like a half-plane.  But
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbifold#2-dimensional_orbifolds">2d
orbifolds</a> can also have
&quot;cone points&quot; and &quot;mirror reflector&quot; points.

<P>
What's a cone point?  It's like the tip of a cone.  Take a piece of
paper, cut it like a pie into n equal wedges, take one wedge, and glue
its edges together!  This gives a cone - and the tip of this cone is a
&quot;cone point&quot;.  We say it has &quot;order n&quot;, because
the angle around it is not 2&pi; but 2&pi;/n.

<P>
Here's a more sophisticated way to say the same thing: take 
a regular n-gon and mod out by its rotational symmetries, which
form a group with n elements.  When we're done, the point in 
the center is a cone point of order n.

<P>
We could also mod out by the rotation <em>and</em> reflection
symmetries of the n-gon, which form a group with 2n elements.  This is
harder to visualize, but when we're done, the point in the center is a
&quot;corner reflector of order 2n&quot;.

<P>
To see one of these fancier possibilities, let's look at the
orbifold coming from a wallpaper pattern with even more symmetries:

<pre>

   .     .     .     .     .     .    
  .................................
   .     .     .     .     .     .    
   .     .     .     .     .     .    
   .     .     .     .     .     .    
  .................................
   .     .     .     .     .     .    
   .     .     .     .     .     .    
   .     .     .     .     .     .    
  .................................
   .     .     .     .     .     .    

</pre>

These are supposed to be rectangles, not squares.
So, 90-degree rotations are not symmetries of this
pattern.  But, in addition to all the symmetries we had
last time, now we have reflections about a bunch of horizontal
lines.  We get a wallpaper group called <a href = 
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_pmm">pmm</a>.

<p>
What orbifold do we get now?  It's a torus
folded in half <i>twice!</i>  That sounds scary,
but it's not really.  We can draw it as a <i>quarter</i> of 
one of the rectangles above:

<pre>

   ....
   .  .
   ....

</pre>
    
Now no points on the edges are glued together.  So, it's just a
rectangle.  The points on the edges are boundary points, and the
corners are corner reflection points of order 4.

<p>
In a certain technical sense - soon to be explained - points on the
edges of this rectangle count as "half points", since they lie on a
reflection line and have been folded in half.  But the corners count
as "1/4 points", since they lie on <i>two</i> reflection lines, so
they've been folded in half <i>twice!</i>

<P>
This is where it gets really cool.  There's a way to define an
&quot;Euler characteristic&quot; for orbifolds that generalizes the
usual formula for 2d manifolds.  And, it can be a fraction!

<P>
The usual formula says to chop our 2d manifold into polygons and 
compute

<P>
V - E + F

<P>
That is: the number of vertices, minus the number of edges, plus the
number of faces. 

<P>
In a 2d orbifold, we use the same formula, but with some
modifications.  First, we require that every cone point or corner
reflector be one of our vertices.  Then:

<ul>
<li> We count edges and vertices
on the boundary for 1/2 the usual amount. 
</li>
<li> We count a cone point of
order n as 1/nth of a point.  
</li>
<li>We count a corner reflector of
order 2n as 1/(2n)th of a point.  
</li>
</ul>

The idea is that these features have
been &quot;folded over&quot; by a certain amount, so they count for a
fraction of what they otherwise would.

<P>
It turns out that if we calculate the Euler characteristic of a 2d
orbifold coming from a wallpaper group, we always get zero.  And,
there are just 17 possibilities!

<P>
In fact, wallpaper groups are secretly
<i>the same</i> as 2d orbifolds with vanishing Euler characteristic!
So, they're not just mathematical curiosities: they're almost
as fundamental as 2d manifolds.

<p>
The torus and the cylinder, which we've already seen, are two
examples.  These are well-known to have Euler characteristic zero.  Of
course, we should be careful: now we're dealing with the cylinder as
an orbifold, so the points on the boundary count as &quot;half
points&quot; - but its Euler characteristic still vanishes.  A more
interesting example is the square we get from the group pmm.  Let's
chop it into vertices, edges, and one face, and figure out how much
each of these count:

<pre>
          1/2 
     1/4-------1/4
      |         | 
      |         | 
   1/2|    1    |1/2 
      |         | 
      |         | 
     1/4-------1/4
          1/2
</pre>
    
So, the Euler characteristic of this orbifold is

<P>
(1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) - (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) + 1 = 0
<P>

This is different than the usual Euler characteristic of a
rectangle!

<P>
As usual, Conway has figured out a charming way to explain all
this:

<a href = "http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/doyle/mpls/handouts/handouts.html">http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/doyle/mpls/handouts/handouts.html</a>

<P>
Especially see the sections near the end entitled &quot;Symmetry and
orbifolds&quot;, &quot;Names for features of symmetrical
pattern&quot;, &quot;Names for symmetry groups and orbifolds&quot;,
&quot;The orbifold shop&quot; and &quot;The Euler characteristic of an
orbifold&quot;.  He has a way of naming 2d orbifolds that lets you
easily see how they &quot;cost&quot;.  Any orbifold that costs 2
dollars corresponds to a wallpaper group, and if you list them, you
see there are exactly 17!

<P>
(I only know two places where the number
17 played an important role in mathematics &mdash; the other is much
more famous.)

<P>
Why exactly 2 dollars?
This is related to this formula for the Euler characteristic 
of a g-handled torus:

<P>
V - E + F = 2 - 2g 

<P>
where g is the number of handles.  At the orbifold shop, each handle
costs 2 dollars.  So, if you buy one handle, you're done: you get an
ordinary torus, which has Euler characteristic zero.  This is the
result of taking the plane and modding out by the most boring 
wallpaper group in the world.  If you don't waste all your money 
on a handle, you can buy more interesting orbifolds.

<P>
Devoted readers of This Week's Finds can guess why I'm talking
about this.  It's not just that I like the Alhambra.  The usual Euler 
characteristic is a generalization of the cardinality of a finite set 
that allows <em>negative</em> values - but not fractional ones.  There's 
also something called the &quot;homotopy cardinality&quot; of a space, which 
allows <em>fractional</em> values - but not negative ones!  

<P>
If we combine these ideas, we get the orbifold Euler characteristic,
which allow both negative and fractional values.  This has various
further generalizations, like the Euler characteristic of a
differentiable stack - and Leinster's Euler characteristic of a
category, explained in &quot;<a href =
"week244.html">week244</A>&quot;.  We should be able to use these to
categorify a lot of math involving rational numbers.

<P>
But, it's especially cool how this game of listing all 2d orbifolds
with Euler characteristic 0 fits together with things like the
&quot;Egyptian fractions&quot; approach to ADE Dynkin diagrams - as
explained in &quot;<a href = "week182.html">week182</A>&quot;.  Here I
used the Euler characteristic to list all ways to regularly tile a
sphere with regular polygons.  This gave the McKay correspondence
linking Platonic solids to the simply-laced Lie algebras
A<sub>n</sub>, D<sub>n</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub> and
E<sub>8</sub>.  Taking different values of the Euler characteristic,
the same idea let us classify regular tilings of the plane or
hyperbolic plane by regular polygons, and see how these correspond to
&quot;affine&quot; or &quot;hyperbolic&quot; simply-laced Kac-Moody
algebras.  Even better, compact quotients of these tilings give some
very nice modular curves, like Klein's quartic curve:

<P>
So, there a lot of connections to be made here... and I can tell I 
haven't made them all yet!  Why don't you give it a try?

<P>
To add to the fun, my friend Eugene Lerman has just written a
very nice survey paper on orbifolds:

<P>
9) Eugene Lerman, Orbifolds as stacks?, available as 
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4160">arXiv:0806.4160</a>.

<P>
This describes some deeper ways to think about orbifolds.  For example, 
when we form an orbifold by taking the plane and modding out by a 
wallpaper group, we shouldn't really say two points on the plane become
<em>equal</em> if there's a symmetry carrying one to the other.  Instead, 
we should say they are <em>isomorphic</em> - with the symmetry being the 
isomorphism.  This gives us a groupoid, whose objects are points 
on the plane and whose morphisms are symmetries taking one point to 
another.  It's a &quot;Lie groupoid&quot;, since there's a manifold of objects 
and a manifold of morphisms, and everything in sight is smooth.

<P>
So, orbifolds can be thought of as Lie groupoids.  This leads to
the real point of Lerman's paper: orbifolds form a 2-category!
This should be easy to believe, since there's a 2-category with

<P>
<ul>
<li>
groupoids as objects,
<li>
functors as morphisms, and 
<li>
natural transformations as 2-morphisms.
</ul>

<P>
In &quot;<a href = "week75.html">week75</A>&quot; and &quot;<a href =
"week80.html">week80</A>&quot; I explained the closely related
2-category with <em>categories</em> as objects; the same idea works
for groupoids.  So, to get a 2-category of <em>Lie</em> groupoids, we
just need to take this idea and make everything &quot;smooth&quot; in
a suitable sense.

<P>
This turns out to be trickier than you might at first think - and 
that's where &quot;differentiable stacks&quot; come in.  I should
explain these someday, but not today.  For now, try these nice
introductions:

Now, besides the Alhambra, Granada also has a wonderful Department of 
Algebra.  Yes - a whole department, just for algebra!  And this 
department has many experts on categorical groups, also known as
2-groups.  So it's worth noting that there are 2-groups lurking in 
the Alhambra.

<P>
Any object in any category has a group of symmetries.  Similarly, any 
object in any 2-category has a 2-group of symmetries.  So, any orbifold 
has a 2-group of symmetries.  We should be able to get some interesting 
2-groups this way.

<P>
The group of <em>all</em> symmetries of a manifold - its &quot;diffeomorphism 
group&quot; - is quite huge.  That's because you can warp it and bend
it any way you like, as long as that way is smooth.  Similarly, the
2-group of <em>all</em> symmetries of an orbifold will often be quite huge.

<P>
To cut down the symmetry group of a manifold, we can equip it with a
Riemannian metric - a nice distance function - and then consider only
symmetries that preserve distances.  We can get lots of nice groups
this way, called &quot;isometry groups&quot;.  For example, the group
E8, which has been in the news disturbingly often of late, is the
isometry group of a 128-dimensional Riemannian manifold called the
&quot;octooctonionic projective plane&quot;.

<P>
So, maybe we can get some nice 2-groups as &quot;isometry 2-groups&quot; of 
&quot;Riemannian orbifolds&quot;.  Of course, for this to make sense, we need
to know what we mean by a Riemannian metric on on orbifold!  I'm no 
expert on this, but I'm pretty sure the idea makes sense.  And I'm 
pretty sure that the 2d orbifold we get from a specific wallpaper 
pattern has a Riemannian metric coming from the usual distance function 
on the plane.  

<P>
(Warning: the same wallpaper group can arise as symmetries of 
wallpaper patterns that are different enough to give different 
Riemannian orbifolds!)

<P>
So, here's a potentially fun question: what 2-groups show up as 
isometry 2-groups of Riemannian orbifolds coming from wallpaper
patterns?  Try to work out some examples.  I don't expect the answer
to be staggeringly profound - but it sets up a link between the Alhambra 
and 2-groups, and that's cool enough for me!

<P>
By the way, I obtained copies of some very interesting theses in Granada:

<P>
13) Antonio Martinez Cegarra, Cohomologia Varietal, Ph.D. thesis,

<P>
14) Pilar Carrasco, Complejos Hipercruzados: Cohomologia y Extensiones,
Ph. D. thesis, Cuadernos de Algebra 6, Departamento de Algebra y 
Fundamentos, Universidad de Granada, 1987.

<P>
Antonio Cegarra was the one who brought 2-group theory to Granada,
and Pilar Carrasco was his student.   It's unfortunate that these
theses come from the day before electronic typesetting.  Luckily, 
Carrasco's was later turned into a paper:

<P>
15) Pilar Carrasco and Antonio Martinez Cegarra, Group-theoretic
algebraic models for homotopy types, Jour. Pure Appl. Algebra 75
(1991), 195-235.  Also available at

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002240499190133M</a>
(click "Download PDF" at top left).

<P>
This tackles the ever-fascinating, ever-elusive problem of taking the
information in the homotopy type of a topological space and packaging
it in some manageable way.  If our space is connected, with a chosen
basepoint, and it has vanishing homotopy groups above the 2nd, a
2-group will do the job quite nicely!  The same idea should work for
numbers larger than 2, but n-groups get more and more elaborate as n
increases.  Carrasco and Cegarra package all the information into a
&quot;hypercrossed complex&quot;, and I would really like to
understand this better.

<P>
Carrasco and Cegarra's paper is quite dense.   So, I'm very happy to 
hear that Carrasco plans to translate her thesis into English!  

<P>
Before I finish, let me mention one more paper about 2-groups:

<P>
16) João Faria Martins, The fundamental crossed module of the 
complement of a knotted surface, available as <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3921">arxiv:0801.3921</a>.

<P>
Martins was unable to attend the Barcelona workshop on 2-groups,
but I met him later in Lisbon, and he explained some of the ideas
here to me. 

<P>
A crossed module is just another way of thinking about a 2-group.
So, translating the language a bit, the basic concept behind this 
paper is the &quot;fundamental 2-group&quot; of (X,A,x).  Here X is 
a topological space that contains a subspace A that contains a point x.  

<P>
Here's how it goes.  A 2-group is a 2-category with one object:

<PRE>
                      x
</PRE>
a bunch of morphisms: 

<PRE>
                      f
                 x--------&gt;x
</PRE>
(which must all be invertible), and a bunch of 2-morphisms: 

<PRE>
                      f
                  ----&gt;---
                 /         \
                x     T     x
                 \         /
                  ----&gt;----
                      g
</PRE>
(which must also be invertible).  

<P>
So, we get the fundamental 2-group of (X,A,x) as follows:

<ul>
<li>
  Let the only object be the point x.
<li>
  Let the morphisms be paths in A starting and ending at x.
<li>
  Let the 2-morphisms be homotopy classes of paths of paths in X.
</ul>


<P>
If you let A be all of X, you get the fundamental 2-group of (X,x),
and this is what people mean when they say connected pointed homotopy
2-types are classified by 2-groups.  But the generalization is also
quite nice.

<P>
In the above paper, Martins uses this generalization, and a bunch of
other ideas, to give an explicit presentation of the fundamental
2-group of the complement of a 2-knot (a sphere embedded in 4d 
Euclidean space).  In a certain sense this generalizes the usual
&quot;Wirtinger presentation&quot; of the fundamental group of the complement
of a knot.  But, it's a bit different.

<p> 
I should mention the definition of a wallpaper group: it's just a
discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the plane that includes
translations in two linearly independent directions.  We need the
right equivalence relation on these groups to get just 17 of them:
they're equivalent if you can conjugate one by an affine
transformation of the plane and get the other.

<p>
Alas, over at the <em>n</em>-Category Caf&eacute;
 Richard Hepworth has shown
that all the isometry 2-groups of orbifolds coming from wallpaper
groups are equivalent to mere groups.  It's a pity!  But, at least
his remarks shed a lot of light on the general theory of 
isometry 2-groups.

First he wrote:

<blockquote>
  Here is a recipe for computing the isometry 2-groups of a Riemannian
  orbifold X//G, with G a discrete group acting on a connected simply
  connected manifold X.  I think these are precisely the sorts of
  orbifolds you are interested in.  Apologies for the nasty
  presentation!

<p>
  There is one object.

<p>
  The arrows are pairs (f,&phi;) where f is an isometry of X, &phi; an
  automorphism of G, and f is equivariant with respect to &phi;, i.e.
  f(gx) = &phi;(g)f(x).

<p>
  The 2-arrows from (f,&phi;) to (k,&kappa;) are the elements g of G for
  which k = gf and &kappa; = g &phi; g<sup>-1</sup>.

<p>
  I'll leave you to work out the various composition maps.

<p>
  Of course, I haven't told you what a Riemannian metric on an
  orbifold (or groupoid or stack) is.  You can find definitions in
  various places, but in the case in point these things are all
  equivalent to putting a G-invariant metric on X.  (Does one always
  exist?  Yes, but the fact that G acts with finite stabilizers is
  essential here.)

<p>
  I also haven't said how I get the above answer.  If you already knew
  the answer for X = point then the above would be your first guess.  The
  reason the guess is correct is thanks to the assumption that X is
  connected and simply connected: all G-valued functions on X are
  constant, and all G-bundles are trivial.

<p>
  Maybe if you're interested I can go into more detail.
</blockquote>

Then he wrote:

<blockquote>
  Hmm, John and David's discussion has reminded me of a result I once
  proved:

<p>
  Suppose we are given a morphism f:X &rarr; Y of orbifolds and a
  2-automorphism &phi;:f => f.  Then &phi; is trivial if and only if its
  restriction to any point of X is trivial.

<p>
  One consequence of this is the following:

<p>
  Let X be an "effective" orbifold.  Then any self-equivalence of X
  has no nontrivial automorphisms.
<p>
  And in particular:

<p>
  The isometry 2-group of an effective orbifold is equivalent to a group.

<p>
  What does "effective" mean?  It means that the automorphism group of
  any point in X acts effectively on its tangent space, and
  consequently that almost all points of the orbifold have no inertia
  at all.  This includes all of the orbifolds you are discussing. The
  fact that the isometry 2-groups are all equivalent to groups is
  apparent in the description I gave earlier: if we have a 2-arrow
  g:(f,&phi;) => (f,&phi;) then gf = f, so that g is the identity.

<p>
  Of course, there are many interesting noneffective orbifolds.  Some
  of them are called gerbes.  (Gerbes with band a finite group.)  Maybe
  you want to compute their isometry 2-groups?  Here's a fact for you:

<p>
  The isometry 2-group of the nontrivial Z/2-gerbe over S<sup>2</sup>
  is itself a Z/2-gerbe over O(3), the isometry group of
  S<sup>2</sup>.  In particular, it is not equivalent to any group.

<p>
  The gerbe over O(3), however, is trivial. But is there a trivialization 
  that respects the 2-group structure?
</blockquote>

Actually not <em>all</em> the orbifolds coming from wallpaper groups
are &quot;effective&quot; in the above sense.  For the orbifold to be
effective, I believe the corresponding group must include
eitherreflections or glide reflections across two different axes, or a
rotation by less than 180 degrees.  For example, the torus and
&quot;cylinder&quot; described above are noneffective orbifolds.  But,
most of the interesting examples are covered by Hepworth's results,
and the others seem also to have isometry 2-groups that are equivalent
to mere groups.

<p>
According to Hepworth, the first paper &quot;contains the little fact
that implies that the automorphism 2-group of an effective orbifold is
equivalent to a group&quot;.  Of course it contains lots of other
stuff, too!  The second discusses Morse theory on differentiable
Deligne-Mumford stacks (these are the proper &eacute;tale ones).  It
defines Morse functions, vector fields and Riemannian metrics on
differentiable DM stacks.  It also proves that Morse functions are
generic and that vector fields can be integrated.
