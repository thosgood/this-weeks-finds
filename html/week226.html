<P>
This month I'm hanging out at CIRM, the "Centre International de Recontres 
Mathematiques" near Marseille.  It's like a little hotel with a classroom, 
library and computers, set at the edge of a forest that borders the
region of limestone hills and cliffs called the Calanques on the coast 
of the Mediterranean.  All they do here is hold conferences: guests come
in, listen to math talks, and eat nice French meals prepared by the 
overworked staff.  

<P>
This February they're having a conference on logic and computation, 
with a strong slant towards the use of diagrams:

<P>
The first week they had lots of talks on "higher-dimensional rewriting",
where you use diagrams to draw ways of rewriting ways of rewriting ways
of... rewriting strings of symbols.  This is inherently connected to
n-categories, since n-categories show up whenever you consider "processes 
that take a process and turn it into another process" - and iterate 
this notion until your eyes start bugging out.  

<P>
The first week was pretty cool, and I hope to talk about it someday.
The second week I've been recovering from the first week.  But today
I'll start with some astronomy pictures and some gossip I heard about 
cryptography, random sequences, and logic.

<P>
Let's zoom in on NGC 1097.
Here's a photograph of this galaxy taken in ultraviolet
light.  It's a barred spiral galaxy that's colliding with a smaller
elliptical galaxy called NGC 1097A:

<P>
NGC 1097 is called a "Seyfert galaxy" because its center emits lots 
of radio waves, but not enough to be considered a full-fledged "quasar".  
As you can see, the center also emits visible light - and stuff is
swirling into it!

<P>
Recently the VLT has gotten a really close look at the center of 
NGC 1097.  VLT stands for "Very Large Telescope".  It's actually 
four 8-meter telescopes and three smaller auxiliary ones, all of
which can function as a single unit, making it the biggest
telescope in the world.  It's run by Europeans as part of
the "European Southern Observatory" - but it's based on a
mountain called Cerro Paranal in the driest part of the Atacama 
Desert in northern Chile, which makes for wonderful viewing 
conditions.  They had to carry the enormous mirrors across 
rugged desert roads to build this observatory:

but the view of the night sky up there makes it all worthwhile:

<P>
So, what did they see when they looked at NGC 1097?

<P>
In the middle there seems to be a black hole, emitting radiation 
as filaments of gas and dust spiral in.  This has caused a ring
of new stars to form, which are ionizing the hydrogen in their vicinity:

<P>
This ring is about 5,500 light-years across!  That sounds big, but the
galaxy is 45 million light-years away, so this is a stunningly detailed
photo.  So, we can examine in great detail the process by which black
holes eat galaxies.

<P>
Anyway....

<P>
Talking to the logicians and computer scientists here, I'm hearing
lots of gossip that I don't usually get.  For example, I just learned
that in 2004 there was a successful collision attack on MD5.

<P>
Huh?  Well, it sounds very technical, but it boils down to this: it 
means somebody took a function f that is known not to be one-to-one,
and found x and y such that f(x) = f(y).  

<P>
You wouldn't think this would make news!  But such functions, called 
"cryptographic hash functions", are used throughout the computer security 
business.   The idea is that you can take any file and apply the hash 
function to compute a string of, say, 128 bits.  It's supposed to be hard 
to find two files that give the same bit string.  This lets you use the
bit string as a kind of summary or "digest" of the file.  It's also 
supposed to be hard to guess the contents of a file from its digest.
This lets you show someone the digest of a file without giving away
any secrets.

<P>
MD5 is a popular hash function invented by Ron Rivest in 1991.  People
use it for checking the integrity of files: first you compute the digest 
of a file, and then, when you send the file to someone, you send the
digest via some separate channel.
If they're worried that the file has been corrupted or 
tampered with, they compute its digest and compare it to what you sent them.  

<P>
People also use MD5 and other hash functions for things like keeping
passwords safe, digital
fingerprinting and copy protection.   To illustrate this I'll give a
silly example that's easy to understand.

<P>
Suppose that this February, Alice proves that P = NP.  She wants to 
take her time writing a nice paper about it... but she wants to be 
able to show she was the first to solve this problem, in case anyone 
else solves it while she's writing her paper.

<P>
To do this, she types up a quick note explaining her solution, feeds 
this file into a cryptographic hash function, and posts the resulting 
128-bit string to the newsgroup sci.math in an article entitled 
"I PROVED P = NP!"  A dated copy appears on Google for everyone to see.

<P>
Now, if Bob solves the problem in July while Alice is still writing up 
her solution, Alice can reveal her note.  If anyone doubts she wrote
her note back in February, they can apply the cryptographic hash function
and check that yes, the result matches the bit string she posted on Google!

<P>
For this to work, it had better be hard for a nasty version of Alice
to take Bob's solution and cook up some note summarizing it whose hash 
function equals some bit string she already posted.  

<P>
So, it's very good if the hash function is resistant to a "preimage 
attack".  A preimage attack is where for a given x you have a trick 
for finding y such that f(y) = f(x).  

<P>
Nobody has carried out a successful preimage attack on MD5.  But, 
people have carried out a successful "collision attack".  This is 
where you can cook up pairs x, y such that f(x) = f(y).  This isn't 
as useful, since you don't have control over <em>either</em> x or y.  But, 
there do exist fiendish schemes for conning people using collision attacks:

"The Story of Alice and Her Boss", <A HREF = "http://www.cits.rub.de/MD5Collisions/">http://www.cits.rub.de/MD5Collisions/</A>

<P>
On this webpage you can see a letter of recommendation for Alice and
a letter granting her a security clearance which both have the same MD5
digest!  It also explains how Alice could use these to do evil deeds.

<P>

9) Cryptographic hash function, Wikipedia, 
<A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash</A>

<P>

<A HREF = "http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-crypto-hashes.html">
http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-crypto-hashes.html</A>

<P>
Now, if you're a mathematician, the whole idea of a cryptographic 
hash function may seem counterintuitive.  Just for a change of pace, 
take another important cryptographic hash function, called SHA-1.  
This is a function that takes any string of up to 2<sup>64</sup> bits and 
gives a digest that's 160 bits long.  So, it's just some function

<P>
f: S &rarr; T

<P>
from a set S of size 2<sup>(2<sup>64</sup> + 1)</sup> to a set T 
of size 2<sup>160</sup>. 

<P>
The first set is vastly bigger.   So, the function f must be far from 
one-to-one!  So why in the world is anyone surprised, much less dismayed, 
when people find a way to generate two elements in the first set that map 
to the same element in the second?

<P>
One reason is that while the first set is much bigger than the second, 
the second is mighty big too!  

<P>
Suppose you're trying to do a preimage attack.  Someone hands you an 
element of T and asks you to find an element of S that maps to it.  
The brute-force approach, where you keep choosing elements of S, 
applying the function, and seeing if you get the desired element, 
will on average take about 2<sup>160</sup> tries.  That's infeasible.  

<P>
Note that the huge size of S is irrelevant here; what matters most
is the size of T.

<P>
Or, suppose you're trying a brute-force collision attack.  You start 
looking through elements of S, trying to find two that map to the same
thing.  On average it will take 2<sup>80</sup> tries - the square root of the
size of T.  That's a lot less, but still infeasible.  

<P>
(Why so much less?  This is called the "birthday paradox": it's a lot
easier to find two people at a big party who share the same birthday
than to find someone with the same birthday as the host.)

<P>
Of course, a smarter approach is to use your knowledge about the function 
f to help you find pairs of elements that map to the same thing.  This 
is what Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu actually did in 
February 2005.  Based on trials with watered-down versions of SHA-1, 
they argued that they could do a collision attack that would take only 
2<sup>69</sup> tries instead of the expected 2<sup>80</sup>.

<P>
They didn't actually carry out this attack - with the computer power 
they had, it would have taken them 5 million years.  But their
theoretical argument was already enough to make people nervous!  

<P>
And indeed, in August 2005, an improved version of their strategy
reduced the necessary number of tries to 2<sup>63</sup> - in other words,
reducing the time to just 78 thousand years, after only a few months 
of work.

<P>
So, people are getting wary of SHA-1.  This is serious, because it's
a widely used government standard.  You can see the algorithm for this
function here:

<P>
10) SHA hash functions, Wikipedia, 
<A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions</A>

<P>
People still hope that good hash functions exist.  They hope that if 
a function f is cleverly chosen, f(x) will depend in a "seemingly 
random" way on x, so that given f(x), it's hard to compute some y 
with f(y) = f(x).  People call this a "one-way function".  

<P>
Now we're finally getting to the really interesting math.  It takes work 
to make the concept of "one-way function" precise, but it can be done.
For example, Chapter 2 of this book starts out by defining "strong" and 
"weak" one-way functions:

<P>
11) Oded Goldreich, Foundations of Cryptography, Cambridge U.
Press, Cambridge, 2004.  Older edition available at 
<A HREF = "http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/frag.html"> 
http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/frag.html</A> 

<P>
Since you can look them up and they're a bit gnarly, I won't give
these definitions here.  But <em>roughly</em>, a "strong one-way function"  
is a function f that satisfies two conditions:

<OL>
<LI>
 You can compute f in "polynomial time": in other words,
 there's an algorithm that computes it in a number of steps
 bounded by some polynomial in the length of the input.

<LI>
 Given some input x, any polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm 
 has a very low chance of finding y with f(y) = f(x).  Here a 
 "probabilistic algorithm" is just an algorithm equipped with 
 access to a random number generator.
</OL>

<P>
Condition 2 is related to the idea of a "preimage attack".
We allow the attacker to use a probabilistic algorithm because
it seems this can help them, and a strong one-way function 
should be able to resist even really nasty attacks.

<P>
Unfortunately, nobody has proved that a one-way function exists!

<P>
In fact, the existence of a one-way function would imply that 
"P does not equal NP".  But, proving or disproving this claim is one 
of the most profound unsolved math problems around.  If you settle it, 
you'll get a million dollars from the Clay Mathematics Institute:

<P>
11) Clay Mathematics Institute, P vs NP problem, 
<A HREF = "http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/">http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/</A>

<P>
But if you prove that P <em>does</em> equal NP, you might make more money by 
breaking cryptographic hash codes and setting yourself up as the Napoleon 
of crime. 

<P>
The existence of one-way-functions is also closely related to the 
existence of "pseudorandom" sequences.  These are sequences of 
numbers that "seem" random, but can be computed using deterministic 
algorithms - so they're not <em>really</em> random.  

<P>
To see the relation, recall that a good cryptographic hash code
shouldn't let you guess a message from its digest.  So, for example,
if my message is the EMPTY STRING - no message at all! - its digest
should be a pseudorandom sequence.  

<P>
For example, if we apply SHA-1 to the empty string we get the
following 160 bits, written as 40 hexadecimal digits:

<P>
SHA1("") = "da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709"
<P>

Seems mighty random to me!  But of course it comes out the same every time.  

<P>
Indeed, if you've ever seen a "random number generator" while messing 
with computers, it probably was a pseudorandom number generator.  There 
are a few people who generate random numbers from physical phenomena
like atmospheric noise.  In fact, there's a website called random.org 
where you can get such numbers for free:

<P>
12) Random.org: random integer generator, <A HREF = "http://random.org/">http://random.org/</A>

<P>
There's also a website that offers <em>nonrandom</em> numbers:

<P>
13) NoEntropy.net: your online source for truly deterministic numbers,
<A HREF = "http://www.noentropy.net/">http://www.noentropy.net/</A>

<P>
But joking aside, it's a really tantalizing and famous problem to figure 
out what "random" means, and what it means for something to "seem" 
random even if it's the result of a deterministic process.  These are 
huge and wonderful philosophico-physico-mathematical questions with 
serious practical implications.  Much ink has been spilt regarding these,
and I don't have the energy to discuss them carefully, so I'll just 
say some stuff to pique your curiosity, and then give you some references.

<P>
We can define a "random sequence" to be one that no algorithm can generate
with a success rate better than chance would dictate.  By virtue of this
definition, no algorithm can generate truly random sequences.  
It's easy to prove that most sequences are random - but it's also
easy to prove that you can never exhibit any one <em>particular</em> sequence
and prove it's random!  Chaitin has given a wonderful definition of a particular
random sequence of bits called &Omega; using the fact that no algorithm 
can decide which Turing machines halt... but this random sequence is 
uncomputable, so you can't really "exhibit" it:

<P>
14) Gregory Chaitin, Paradoxes of randomness, Complexity 7 (2002), 14-21.
Also available as <A HREF = "http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/summer.html">http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/summer.html</A>

<P>
So, true randomness is somewhat elusive.  It seems hard to come by except 
in quantum mechanics.  For example, the time at which a radioactive 
atom decays is believed to be <em>really</em> random.  I'll be pissed off if 
it turns out that God (or his henchman Satan) is fooling us by simulating 
quantum mechanics with some cheap pseudorandom number generator!

<P>
Similarly, we could define a "pseudorandom sequence" to be one that no 
<em>efficient</em> algorithm can generate with a success rate higher 
than chance would dictate.  

<P>
Efficiency is a somewhat vague concept.   It's popular to define it by
saying an algorithm is "efficient" if it runs in "polynomial time": the 
time it takes to run is bounded by some polynomial function of the 
size of the input data.  If the polynomial is

<P>
p(n) = 1000000000000000 n<sup>1000000000000000</sup> + 1000000000000000 

<P>
most people wouldn't consider the algorithm efficient, but this definition
is good for proving theorems, and usually in practice the polynomial
turns out to be more reasonable.

<P>
A "pseudorandom number generator" needs to be defined carefully if
we want to find efficient algorithms that do this job.  After all,
no efficient algorithm can produce a sequence that no efficient 
algorithm can guess: <em>it</em> can always guess what it's going to do! 

<P>
So, the basic idea is that a pseudorandom number generator should be
an efficient algorithm that maps short truly random strings to long
pseudorandom strings: we give it a short random "seed" and it cranks
out a lot of digits that no efficient algorithm can guess with a
success rate higher than chance would dictate.

<P>
Unfortunately, nobody has proved that pseudorandom number generators
exist!  So, this whole subject is a bit like axiomatic quantum field
theory, or the legendary Ph.D thesis where the student couldn't produce
any examples of the mathematical gadgets he was studying.  It's a
risky business proving results about things that might not exist.
But in the case of pseudorandom number generators, the subject is
too important not to take the chance.

<P>
One of the most interesting things about pseudorandom number generators is 
that they let us mimic probabilistic algorithms with deterministic ones.  
In fact there are some nice theorems about this.  Let me sketch one of
them for you.

<P>
As I already mentioned, a "probabilistic algorithm" is just a deterministic 
algorithm that's been equipped with access to a (true) random number 
generator.   Just imagine a computer with the ability to reach out and 
flip a coin when it wants to.  A problem is said to be in "BPP" - 
"bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time" - if you can find 
polynomial-time probabilistic algorithms that solve this problem 
with arbitrarily high chance of success.  

<P>
It's a fascinating question whether randomness actually helps you compute
stuff.  I guess most computer scientists think it does.  But, it's tricky.  
For example, consider the problem of deciding whether an integer is prime.  
Nobody knew how to do this in polynomial time... but then in 1977, Solovay
and Strassen showed this problem was in BPP.  This is one of the results
that got people really excited about probabilistic algorithms.

<P>
However, in 2002, Maninda Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena showed 
that deciding whether numbers are prime is in P!  In other words, it can 
be solved in polynomial time by a plain old deterministic algorithm:

<A HREF = "http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~stiglic/PRIMES_P_FAQ.html">http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~stiglic/PRIMES_P_FAQ.html</A>

<P>
Is BPP = P?  Nobody knows!  But if good enough pseudorandom number
generators could be shown to exist, we would have BPP = P, since then we
could use these pseudorandom numbers as a substitute for truly random ones.  
This is not obvious, but it was proved by Nisan and Wigderson in 1994.

<P>
Here's a great review article that discusses their result:

<P>
This is a delightfully funny and mindblowing crash course on logic. 
It starts with a review of first-order logic and G&ouml;del's theorems,
featuring a dialog between a mathematician and the axiom system
ZF+not(Con(ZF)).   Here ZF is the popular Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms 
for set theory and not(Con(ZF)) is a statement asserting that ZF
is not consistent.  Thanks to G&ouml;del's second incompleteness theorem,
ZF+not(Con(ZF)) is consistent if ZF is!  The mathematician is naturally
puzzled by this state of affairs, but in this dialog, the axiom system
explains how it works.

<P>
Then Aaronson zips on through Loeb's theorem, which is even weirder than 
G&ouml;del's first incompleteness theorem.  G&ouml;del's first incompleteness
theorem says that the statement 

<P>
<DIV ALIGN = CENTER>
This statement is unprovable in ZF.
</DIV>

<P>
is not provable in ZF, as long as ZF is consistent.  Loeb's theorem says that 
the statement 

<P>
<DIV ALIGN = CENTER>
This statement is provable in ZF.
</DIV>

<P>
<em>is</em> provable in ZF.  

<P>
Then Aaronson gets to the heart of the subject: a history of the P vs. NP 
question.  This leads up to an amazing paper of Razborov and Rudich, 
which I'll now summarize:

<P>
The basic point of this paper is that if P is not equal to NP, as most
mathematicians expect, then this fact is hard to prove!  Or, as Aaron
more dramatically puts it, this conjecture "all but 
asserts the titanic difficulty of finding its own proof".

<P>
Zounds!  But let's be a bit more precise.  A Boolean circuit is a gizmo
built of "and", "or" and "not" gates, without any loops.  We can think 
of this as computing a Boolean function, meaning a function of the form:

<P>
f: {0,1}<sup>n</sup> &rarr; {0,1} 

<P>
Razborov and Rudich start by studying a common technique for proving lower 
bounds on the size of a Boolean circuit that computes a given function.  
The technique goes like this:

<OL>
<LI>
  Invent some way of measuring the complexity of a Boolean function.

<LI>
 Show that any Boolean circuit of a certain size can compute only 
 functions of complexity less than some amount. 

<LI>
 Show that the function f has high complexity.

</OL>

<P>
They call this style of proof a "natural" proof.  

<P>
The P versus NP question can be formulated as a question about the size
of Boolean circuits - but Razborov and Rudich show that, under certain 
assumptions, there is no "natural" proof that P is not equal to NP.  
What are these assumptions?  They concern the existence of good 
pseudorandom number generators.  However, the existence of these 
pseudorandom number generators would follow from the fact that P 
is not equal to NP.  So, if "P is not equal to NP"
is true, it has no natural proof.  

<P>
Aaronson says this is the deepest insight into the P versus NP question
so far.  I would like to understand it better - I explained it very
sketchily because I don't really understand it yet.  Aaronson recommends 
us to these papers for more details:

Aaronson wraps up by musing on the possibility that the P versus NP 
question is independent from strong axiom systems like Zermelo-Fraenkel 
set theory.  It's possible... and it's possible that this is true and
unprovable!

<P>
So, there is a fascinating relationship between one-way functions, 
pseudorandom numbers, and incompleteness - but it's a relationship 
shrouded in mystery... and perhaps inevitably so.  Perhaps it will
always remain unknown whether this mystery is inevitable... and perhaps 
this is inevitable too!  And so on.

<P>
Here's a question for you experts out there: have people studied G&ouml;del-like
self-referential sentences of this form?

<P>
<DIV ALIGN = CENTER>
             The shortest proof of this statement has n lines.
</DIV>

<P>
I hear that people <em>have</em> studied ones like 

<P>
<DIV ALIGN = CENTER>
              The shortest proof that 0 = 1 has n lines.
</DIV>

<P>
and they've proved that the shortest proof of <em>this</em> has to keep getting 
longer with larger n, as long as one is working in a sufficiently powerful
and consistent axiom system.  This is fairly obvious if you know how
G&ouml;del's second incompleteness theorem is proved... but it's possible that
some interesting, nonobvious lower bounds have been proved.  If so, I'd
like to know!

Here is some discussion with Wolfgang Brand, Allan Erskine, 
Scott Aaronson, Aaron Bergman and an entity named tessel.  I had written:

<blockquote>
Chaitin has given a marvelous definition of a 
particular random sequence of bits called &Omega; using the fact that no 
algorithm can decide which Turing machines halt... but this random 
sequence is uncomputable, so you can't really "exhibit" it.

Hah!  This, by the way, is the key to that puzzle I laid out: 
prove that there's a constant K such that no bitstring can be 
proved to have algorithmic entropy greater than K.   

<P>
Let me take this as an excuse to say a bit more about this.
I won't give away the answer to the puzzle; anyone who gets
stuck can find the answer in this nice survey:

<P>

<P>
In my more rhapsodic moments, I like to think of K as the 
"complexity barrier".  The world <em>seems</em> to be full of incredibly 
complicated structures - but the constant K sets a limit on our 
ability to <em>prove</em> this.   Given any string of bits, we can't rule 
out the possibility that there's some clever way of printing it 
out using a computer program less than K bits long.  The Encyclopedia 
Brittanica, the human genome, the detailed atom-by-atom recipe for 
constructing a blue whale, or for that matter the entire solar system 
- we are unable to prove that a computer program less than K bits 
long couldn't print these out.  So we can't firmly rule out the 
reductionistic dream that the whole universe evolved mechanistically 
starting from a small "seed", a bitstring less than K bits long.  
(Maybe it did!)

<P>
So this raises the question, how big is K?

<P>
It depends on ones axioms for mathematics.  

<P>
Recall that the algorithmic entropy of a bitstring is defined
as the length of the shortest program that prints it out.  For
any finite consistent first-order axiom system A exending the
usual axioms of arithmetic, let K(A) be the constant such that
no bitstring can be proved, using A, to have algorithmic entropy
greater than K(A).  We can't compute K(A) exactly, but there's a 
simple upper bound for it.  As Gacs explains, for some constant c 
we have:
<P>
K(A) < L(A) + 2 log<sub>2</sub> L(A) + c
<P>
where L(A) denotes the length of the axiom system A, encoded as
bits as efficiently as possible.  I believe the constant c is 
computable, though of course it depends on details like what 
universal Turing machine you're using as your computer.  

<P>
What I want to know is, how big in practice is this upper
bound on K(A)?  I think it's not very big!   The main problem 
is to work out a bound on c.

  and responses that you might find helpful.

<P>
  It's not known whether P&ne;NP implies the existence of one-way functions 
  (OWF's) - indeed, there's evidence that proving such an implication 
  will be hard:

  What's known is that one-way functions exist iff pseudorandom generators 
  (PRG's) do - that's a long, gnarly result of Hastad et al.:

<P>
  So when I wrote that Razborov-Rudich illustrates the "self-referentiality" 
  of proving P&ne;NP, really I meant that it illustrates the self-referentiality 
  of proving that OWF's and PRG's exist!  But most of us believe not only 
  that P&ne;NP, but also that OWF's exist, and that all of these questions 
  are "morally similar" anyway... :)

<P>
  You write: "It's a fascinating question whether randomness actually helps 
  you compute stuff. I guess most computer scientists think it does."

<P>
  Well, today most of us think that good pseudorandom generators exist, 
  which (as you pointed out) implies that P=BPP.  That's not to say that 
  randomness never helps; it just doesn't provide more than a polynomial 
  advantage.

<P>
  Incidentally, it followed already from Andy Yao's work in 1982 that if 
  REALLY good pseudorandom generators exist, then P=BPP.  What Nisan and 
  Wigderson showed in 1994 was that even if only kinda sorta good PRG's 
  exist, then still P=BPP!

<P>
  Since you wrote at length about hash functions like MD5, you might be 
  interested in the following abstraction of the collision-finding problem.  
  Suppose we have a two-to-one function 
 
<P>
  f: {0,1}<sup>n</sup> &rarr; {0,1}<sup>n-1</sup>, 

<P>
  which we can only access in a "black-box" fashion - i.e., we can feed 
  it an input and get an output.  The goal is to find distinct x and y 
  such that f(x)=f(y).  Classically, it's easy to see that ~2<sup>n/2</sup> 
  accesses 
  to f are necessary and sufficient - that's just the birthday paradox you 
  described.  But what if we can access f in quantum superposition, to 
  create states like
 
<P>
  &sum;<sub>x</sub> |x>|f(x)>?

<P>
  In that case, it turns out that one can combine the birthday paradox with 
  Grover's quantum search algorithm, to find a collision using ~2<sup>n/3</sup>
  accesses to f instead of ~2<sup>n/2</sup>.  But could we do it with 
  n<sup>O(1)</sup> 
  accesses, or even a <em>constant</em> number independent of n?  You might be 
  surprised that this was open for years!
 
<P>
  Probably my best-known result was to show that ~2<sup>n/5</sup> accesses are 
  needed:

  You ask why theoretical computer scientists don't use the arXiv.  The

  so long.  But in classical complexity, if you want your paper to be read, 
  then you (1) put in on your homepage, (2) submit it to STOC or FOCS, 
  which are the top conferences in the field (and are MUCH more important 
  than journals), and (3) post it here:

  I like your finite G&ouml;del statement!  Let me restate it as follows:
 
<P>
  G(n) = "This statement has no ZF proof of at most n symbols."
 
<P>
  What can we say?  Obviously, if ZF is consistent, then G(n) has no 
  proof of at most n symbols.  Hence G(n) is true.  Furthermore, G(n) 
  has a proof of ~2<sup>n</sup> symbols.  This proof simply enumerates all 
  proofs of &le;n symbols, and shows that none of them work.

<P>
  You might wonder: does G(n) have a proof of n+1 symbols, or for that 
  matter n<sup>O(1)</sup> symbols?  
  This turns out to be related to the main open 
  questions of complexity theory!  In particular, if NP=coNP, then G(n) 
  has a proof of n<sup>O(1)</sup> symbols.  NP=coNP just means that, whenever a 
  Boolean formula of size n is unsatisfiable, there's a proof of that 
  fact of length polynomial in n.  Clearly if P=NP then NP=coNP, but the 
  converse isn't known.  The prevailing belief is not only that P&ne;NP, 
  but also that NP&ne;coNP.

<P>
  Actually I can say more than that: if NE=coNE, then G(n) has a proof 
  of n<sup>O(1)</sup> symbols.  Here NE is Nondeterministic Exponential-Time, 
  or the exponential-time analogue of NP.  (See my Complexity Zoo:

<P>
32) Scott Aaronson and Greg Kuperberg, Complexity Zoo,
 <A HREF = "http://qwiki.caltech.edu/wiki/Complexity_Zoo">http://qwiki.caltech.edu/wiki/Complexity_Zoo</A>

<P>
  for lots more about this and other classes.)  coNE is just the 
  complement of NE.  If NP=coNP then NE=coNE, but again the converse 
  isn't known.

<P>
  What do these weird exponential classes have to do with G(n)?  The 
  point is that to describe an integer n takes only log(n) symbols, 
  not n symbols.  So when we ask for a proof of G(n) with at most n 
  symbols, from "log(n)'s standpoint" we're actually asking for an 
  exponentially long proof.

<P>
  At this point I'll conjecture that I have an "if and only if" 
  characterization: if G(n) has a proof of n<sup>O(1)</sup> 
  symbols, then NE=coNE.
 
<P>
  Incidentally, your "finite G&ouml;del statement" is closely related to the 
  Hartmanis-Stearns time hierarchy theorem, which launched computational 
  complexity in the mid-1960's.  The time hierarchy theorem is a finite 
  version of Turing's undecidability theorem, where instead of asking 
  whether a given Turing machine ever halts, you ask whether it halts 
  after at most T steps.  Solving this problem turns out to take slightly 
  more than T steps.  So in particular, you can solve more problems in 
  n<sup>2</sup> time than in n time, more in 
  n<sup>3</sup> time than in n<sup>2</sup> time, and so on.

  Let me know if you have other questions.

I was very interested in this question back in college, and I

This seemed interesting at the time because Pour-El and Richards

Anyway, I came away feeling that time evolution for any PDE people actually
care about is computable once you define your concepts correctly.  This is 
simply a way of saying that you can numerically compute the solutions to any
desired accuracy: it's sort of obvious, modulo the crucial technical details.

But a more interesting question would be the one you ask, where
mere "computability" is replaced by something more refined, like
"computable up to a specified accuracy in polynomial time".

but these hash function are inefficient and not used in practice.&quot;

<P>
Next, here's yet another email from Scott Aaronson, dated July 22, 2006:

<blockquote>
 Hi John,

<P>
 A while ago you asked whether anyone had studied sentences of the form

<P>
 P(n) = "This statement has no proof at most n symbols long."

<P>
 Clearly P(n) has a proof with ~2<sup>n</sup> symbols.  I emailed you
 conjecturing that P(n) has no proof much shorter than that.

<P>
 Well, I just came back from a complexity meeting in Prague, where
 Pavel Pudlak gave a talk about exactly this sort of question.  It
 turns out that Harvey Friedman made the same conjecture I did in the
 1970's, but his conjecture was soon shown to be FALSE!  Indeed, the
 number of symbols needed to prove P(n) grows only a little bit faster
 than n itself.

<P>
 Let me sketch why, since I'm guessing this will be as surprising to
 you as it was to me.

<P>
 To prove P(n), it clearly suffices to show that, if our proof system
 is inconsistent, then any proof of 0=1 must contain statements with
 more than n symbols.  We can do that using a technique invented by
 Tarski in the 1930's for "defining truth" - i.e., for recursively
 building up a one-to-one correspondence between syntax and semantics.
 More concretely, let T<sub>k</sub>(A) be a function that takes as
 input a string A with <font face = "symbol">&#163;</font>k symbols.  We want T<sub>k</sub> to return 1
 if A encodes a true statement and 0 otherwise.  So for all k<n, we'll
 stipulate that

<P>
 T<sub>k+1</sub>( "not" + A ) := 1 if T<sub>k</sub>(A)=0, or 0 otherwise.

<P>
 T<sub>k+1</sub>( A + "and" + B ) := 1 if T<sub>k</sub>(A)=1 and
 T<sub>k</sub>(B)=1, or 0 otherwise.

<P>
 T<sub>k+1</sub>( "There exists an x such that" + A ) := 1 if there exists an
 x* such that T<sub>k</sub>(A[x=x*])=1, or 0 otherwise.

<P>
 and so on.  Of course I'm skipping lots of technicalities, like what I
 mean by A[x=x*].

<P>
 Anyway, one can prove that, if T<sub>n</sub>(A)=T<sub>n</sub>(B)=1,
 and if C is derivable from A and B via a first-order inference rule,
 then T<sub>n</sub>(C)=1 as well.  Also, if A is an axiom of our proof
 system, then (reasoning <em>within</em> the system) A is true, and hence
 T<sub>n</sub>(A)=1.

<P>
 It follows that, as long as we restrict ourselves to statements of
 length <font face = "symbol">&#163;</font>n, no contradiction can be proved.  
  Furthermore, we can
 formalize the whole argument using only O(n) symbols (or maybe O(n log(n)), 
 depending on the proof system).

<P>
 So what's the catch?  Why can't we generalize this argument to
 statements of <em>all</em> lengths, thereby contradicting the Incompleteness
 Theorem?  Because, when we examine the proof that the syntax correctly
 models the semantics, we'll always find that it involves statements
 with more than n quantifiers.  I.e. to prove consistency for
 statements with n quantifiers, we need at least n+1 quantifiers.

<P>
 So, is there any way to salvage a finitary G&ouml;del's Theorem?  There
 probably is!  In particular, consider the following statement:
 
<P>
 P(n,k) = "This statement has no proof at most n symbols long,
 involving statements with at most k quantifiers."

<P>
 The new conjecture would be that, for every fixed k, P(n,k) has no
 proof with less than 2<sup>O(n)</sup> symbols involving statements with at 
 most k quantifiers.  According to Pavel, this conjecture is still open.
 Indeed, it's not even known whether P(n) itself has a proof with less
 than 2<sup>O(n)</sup> symbols, involving statements with at most k quantifiers
 for some fixed k.
