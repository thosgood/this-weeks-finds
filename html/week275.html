Long time no see!  I've been really busy, but now classes are over,
and like last summer, I'm visiting Paul-Andr&eacute; Melli&egrave;s,
who works on logic, computer science and categories.

<P>
I should be finishing up some more papers, but let me take a little 
break, and tell you about an old dream that's starting to come true.
People are finally starting to understand extended topological
quantum field theories using n-categories!   

<P>
Back in 1995, Jim Dolan and I argued that n-dimensional extended 
TQFTS were representations of a certain n-category called nCob in 
which:

<ul>
<li>
 objects are 0-dimensional manifolds: that is, collections of points,
</li>
<li>
 morphisms are 1-dimensional manifolds with boundary going between
 collections of points,
</li>
<li>
 2-morphisms are 2-dimensional manifolds with corners going between
 1-dimensional manifolds with boundary going between collections of
 points,
</li>
</ul>

... and so on, up to dimension n.  In particular, any n-dimensional
manifolds is an n-morphism in nCob.  

<P>
And, we thought we could glimpse a purely algebraic description of
nCob.  We called this the &quot;cobordism hypothesis&quot;, and we explained 
it here:

<P>
Now Jacob Lurie has come out with a draft of an expository paper 
that outlines a massive program, developed with help from Mike Hopkins,
to reformulate the cobordism hypothesis using more ideas from homotopy theory, and prove it:

<P>
Excited by this new progress, I decided to run around giving some 
talks about it myself - just to explain the basic intuitions to 
people who'd never thought about this stuff before.  You can see
my slides here:

<a href = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cat/">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/cat/</a>

<P>
A key feature of Lurie's approach is that instead of using
n-categories he uses (&infin;,n)-categories, which are
&infin;-categories where everything is invertible above dimension n.
This is what gets ideas from homotopy theory into the game.
I should talk about this more someday.

<P>
Meanwhile, Chris Schommer-Pries has written a thesis on 2d extended
TQFTs which follows an approach much closer to what Jim and I had originally
imagined.  You could say he gives more of an individually hand-crafted
treatment of the n = 2 case, as compared with Lurie's high-tech industrial 
approach that clobbers all n at once:

<P>
6) Chris Schommer-Pries, The Classification of Two-Dimensional 
Extended Topological Field Theories, Ph.D. theis, U.C. Berkeley, 2009.
Available at <a href = "http://sites.google.com/site/chrisschommerpriesmath/">http://sites.google.com/site/chrisschommerpriesmath/</a>

<P>
Instead of (&infin;,n)-categories, Schommer-Pries just uses n-categories - 
and since he's doing 2d TQFTs, that means 2-categories.
Or more precisely, &quot;weak&quot; 2-categories, where all the laws hold
only up to equivalence.  Like most people, he calls these 
&quot;bicategories&quot;.  And one of the charms of his thesis is that he 
gives a detailed treatment of the n = 2 column of the periodic
table of n-categories - which in his language looks like this:

<PRE>
                   k-tuply monoidal n-categories 

<P>
              n = 0           n = 1              n = 2

k = 0         sets          categories        bicategories

k = 1        monoids         monoidal           monoidal
                            categories        bicategories

k = 2       commutative      braided            braided
             monoids         monoidal           monoidal
                            categories        bicategories 

k = 3         &quot; &quot;           symmetric          sylleptic
                             monoidal          monoidal 
                            categories        bicategories

k = 4         &quot; &quot;             &quot; &quot;              symmetric
                                               monoidal
                                              bicategories

k = 5         &quot; &quot;             &quot; &quot;                &quot;  &quot;
</PRE>

<P>
A k-tuply monoidal n-category is an (n+k)-category that's boring
at the bottom k levels.  For example, a category with just one
object is a monoid.  As we increase k, we get more and more 
commutative flavors of n-category.  But after k hits n+2, we
expect that increasing k further has no effect.  At this point we 
say our n-category is &quot;stable&quot;.

<P>
If the cobordism hypothesis is true, nCob is a stable n-category.  
For n = 2, such a gadget is often called a &quot;symmetric monoidal 
bicategory&quot;.  Schommer-Pries shows that 2Cob is indeed a symmetric
monoidal bicategory.  Even better, he gives a &quot;generators and 
relations&quot; description of this gadget, which is just the sort of thing 
we need for the 2d version of the cobordism hypothesis:

<div align = "center">
<img src = "schommer_pries.jpg">
</div>

At this point, any n-category theorist could finish off the job.  

<P>
(Well, the really nice statement of the cobordism hypothesis involves
<em>framed</em> oriented cobordisms, and we may need a topologist to tell us
how those work - but there's also a version of the hypothesis for plain 
old oriented cobordisms, and that's what Schommer-Pries' thesis will
give.)

<P>
For more on nCob as an n-category, try this:

<P>
I should add that a lot of the 2-category theory in Schommer-Pries'
thesis relies on a thesis by a student of Ross Street:

<P>
Two students of mine should read the stuff about symmetric monoidal
bicategories in this thesis!  One is Alex Hoffnung, whose work on
Hecke algebras uses the symmetric monoidal bicategory where:

<ul>
<li>
objects are groupoids,
</li>
<li>
morphisms are spans of groupoids where the legs are fibrations,
</li>
<li>
2-morphisms are maps of spans of groupoids.
</li>
</ul>

<P>
The other is Mike Stay, whose work on computer science uses
the symmetric monoidal bicategory where:

<ul>
<li>
objects are categories,
</li>
<li> 
morphisms are profunctors,
</li>
<li>
2-morphisms are natural transformations between profunctors.
</li>
</ul>

<P>
A profunctor is a categorified version of a matrix.  More precisely,
a profunctor from C to D is a functor

<P>
F: C &times; D<sup>op</sup> &rarr; Set

<P>
so it's like a matrix of sets.  A span of groupoids where the
legs are fibrations is also a categorified version of a matrix,
since by a theorem of Grothendieck we can reinterpret it as a
weak 2-functor

<P>
F: C &times; D<sup>op</sup> &rarr; Gpd

<P>
where now C and D are groupoids.  So, both these students are
studying aspects of &quot;categorified matrix mechanics&quot;... and we
need symmetric monoidal bicategories to provide the proper context
for such work.  This should connect up to the 2d version of the
cobordism hypothesis in some interesting ways.
