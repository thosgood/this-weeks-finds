<P>
No fancy math today.  I've been working hard with Aristide Baratin,
Laurent Freidel and Derek Wise on infinite-dimensional representations
of 2-groups.  It's a gnarly mix of higher category theory and
analysis.  But I won't bother you with that until the paper is done.
I need a break!

<P>
So, today I want to talk about the sulfur geysers on Io, honeycombs,
the work of Kelvin, the Weaire-Phelan structure, and gas clathrates.

<P>
I already teased you with pictures of Jupiter's moon Io in &quot;<a
href = "week266.html">week266</A>&quot; and &quot;<a href =
"week268.html">week268</A>&quot;.  There's a reason.  Tortured by
powerful tidal forces, Io is the most geologically active object in
the Solar System!  It has mountains taller than Mount Everest, and
over 400 active volcanos.  These put out the hottest lava ever seen -
and a lot of it, too.  A big eruption in 1997 produced more than 3500
square kilometers of the stuff!

<P>
Most moons in the outer Solar System are pale and icy.  Io looks like
an evil pizza.  The ghastly red ring in the top view here is
sulfur spewed out by Pele, the biggest volcano on Io:

<P>
Io is big on sulfur.  It has lakes of molten sulfur... pale sulfur
dioxide snow... and geysers spew sulfur dioxide up to 500
kilometers high!  Here's a picture of two such geysers, taken by the
Galileo spacecraft in 1997:

<a href = "http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070211.html">http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070211.html</A>

<P>
At the top horizon you can see a cloud of bluish-white haze.  
It may not look big, but remember: Io is about 3600 kilometers
in diameter, roughly the size of our Moon.  So, that hazy cloud is
actually <i>huge</i>.  It's a geyser plume rising 140 kilometers above a 
massive volcano called Pillan Patera.  If you look carefully you can also 
see the Prometheus plume, dead center, as a blue-grey ring.
This plume has been active at least since 1979 - but it's 
<em>moved 85 kilometers west</em> during that time!  Scary.

<P>
Ironically, all this chaotic activity on Io may be caused by the
&quot;music of the spheres&quot;.  Io is locked in a 2:1 orbital
resonance with the moon Europa, and a 4:1 resonance with Ganymede.
These keep Io's orbit a bit eccentric, which causes tidal heating - to
the tune of about 100 trillion watts.

<P>

<P>
Another interesting thing is that the red spots on Io are made of
sulfur, but so are the yellow plains.  Of course there are lots of
compounds involving sulfur, but even the pure element has a lot of
different forms, or <a href =

I've always been fascinated by those.

<P>
Back here on Earth, the Weaire-Phelan structure was in the news 
recently!  If you watched the Olympics in Beijing, you may have 
seen the National Aquatics Center - a building also called the 
&quot;Water Cube&quot;:

<a href = "http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL?pa=mathNews&amp;sa=view&amp;newsId=392">http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL?pa=mathNews&amp;sa=view&amp;newsId=392</a>

<P>
The design of this building is based on the Weaire-Phelan structure.
But the story behind the design of this building goes back to 36 BC, 
when Marcus Terentius Varro described two competing theories for
why bees have hexagonal honeycombs.  The first said: because bees 
have six legs!  The second said: efficiency!  You see, a hexagonal 
lattice lets you divide the plane into cells of equal area with 
the least possible perimeter per cell.  So if the bees want to save 
wax, that's the pattern they'll pick.

<P>
The second theory seems more plausible.  But is it true?  I'm not even
sure how to resolve that question.  But it's worth noting that
honeycomb cells are actually 3-dimensional - and the <em>end</em> of
each cell consists of three rhombi that meet at the same angle as
bubbles in soap suds!

<P>
<div align = "center">
<img src = "honeycomb_cell_rhombic_dodecahedron.jpg">
</div>

<P>
Now, soap films minimize surface area subject to whatever constraints
they encounter.  So, a single bubble that holds a given amount of 
air will form a sphere.  But soap suds with lots of bubbles do more 
complicated things.  Take a bubble bath and pay careful attention!  
You'll see that three bubble faces meet along each edge, at precisely 
120 degree angles.  And when four bubbles meet at a vertex, they form 
a pattern with tetrahedral symmetry, with edges meeting at an angle 
of arccos(-1/3), or about 109.5 degrees. 

<P>
So if honeycombs display these patterns, we can guess area is being
minimized.

<P>
But as usual, things get more complicated when you look deeper.
First, while everyone <em>believed</em> for a long time that a
hexagonal honeycomb is the way to divide the plane into equal-area
cells with minimal perimeters, this was only <em>proved</em> much
later: in 1999, by Thomas Hales.

<P>
It's an interesting story.  Hales had just finished his epic proof of
Kepler's conjecture about the densest way to pack equal-sized spheres
- a proof so complicated that the referees &quot;ran out of
energy&quot; trying to check it.  That's quite a tale in itself... but
to avoid an infinite sequence of nested digressions, I'll refer you to
these:

<P>
Anyway, after Hales proved the Kepler Conjecture, Denis Weaire
suggested that he tackle the Hexagonal Honeycomb Conjecture - and
Hales promptly solved that too!  He said, &quot;In contrast with the
years of forced labor that gave the Kepler Conjecture, I felt as if I
had won the lottery.&quot;

<P>
Hales wasn't the first to make progress on the Hexagonal Honeycomb
Conjecture.  A guy named Fejes Tóth had already proved it's true if we
assume the cells are polygons:

<P>

<P>
So what Hales had to do is rule out cells with curved edges.  This 
is harder than you might think.  In fact, for clusters of finitely 
many cells, the optimal shapes can be curved, even near the middle!

Another thing Tóth did is carefully define the 3d optimization 
problem that bees might be trying to solve, and find a slightly 
better solution:

<P>
I won't try to describe his results in detail, since the paper is
freely available and well-written.  But here's the basic idea.  The 
end of a bee's honeycomb cell looks just like a corner of a 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombic_dodecahedron">rhombic 
dodecahedron</a>: 

<P>
<div align = "center">
<img src = "180px-Rhombicdodecahedron.gif">
</div>

<p>
This is a 12-sided solid that you can pack to completely fill space.
This makes sense, because the ends of one layer of cells in a
honeycomb should neatly fit against those of the next layer.

<P>
However, it's been known since the work of Kelvin that there's another
solid you can use to pack space more efficiently: that is, with less 
surface area per cell.  This is the 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_octahedron">truncated 
octahedron</a>:

<P>
<div align = "center">
<img src = "truncated_octahedron.gif">
</div>

<P>
Using this, Tóth found a design for the end of a honeycomb cell that
would be more efficient than what bees use:

<P>
<div align = "center">
<img src = "honeycomb_cell_truncated_octahedron.jpg">
</div>

<P>
How much more efficient?  How much area did Tóth manage to shave off? 
Almost 0.35% of the area of cell's opening!  In the eternal battle
of man against bee, we triumph yet again!  It makes me proud to be
human.

<P>
Tóth is more modest: 

<blockquote>
   We must admit that all this has no practical consequence....  
   Besides, the building style of the bees is definitely simpler 
   than that described above.  So we would fail in shaking someone's 
   conviction that the bees have a deep geometrical intuition.
</blockquote>

I doubt &quot;intuition&quot; is the right word for it, but they're
definitely good at what they do.

<P>
Now, back to Kelvin!  When he bumped into the truncated octahedron, 
he was actually studying the 3d version of the 2d Hexagonal Honeycomb 
Conjecture.  In other words, he was trying to chop 3d space into cells
of equal volume with the least surface area per cell.  And he
conjectured that the answer was very similar to filling space with
truncated octahedra, as shown here:

<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitruncated_cubic_honeycomb">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitruncated_cubic_honeycomb</a>

<P>
I say &quot;very similar&quot; because it's actually more efficient if
you let the hexagonal faces in this structure be slightly
<em>curved</em>.  So, the possibility Hales ruled out in the 2d case
actually matters here!  In his 1887 paper on this subject, Kelvin
wrote:

<blockquote>
   No shading could show satisfactorily the delicate curvature of 
   the hexagonal faces, though it may be fairly well seen on the 
   solid model made as described in Section 12.  But it is shown   
   beautifully, and illustrated in great perfection, by making a 
   skeleton model of 36 wire arcs for the 36 edges of the complete 
   figure, and dipping it in soap solution to fill the faces with 
   film, which is easily done for all the faces but one.  The 
   curvature of the hexagonal film on the two sides of the plane 
   of its six long diagonals is beautifully shown by reflected light.
</blockquote>

I think this is a nice passage.  We may remember Kelvin for his
profound work on electromagnetism and thermodynamics - or his 1900
lecture on two &quot;dark clouds&quot; hanging over physics: the
Michelson-Morley experiment (which foreshadowed special relativity)
and black body radiation (which foreshadowed quantum mechanics).  We
may not imagine him playing around with soap bubbles!  But it shows
that good science stems from curiosity, and curiosity knows no bounds.

<P>
You can read Kelvin's paper here:

<P>
His lively mind is evident from the selection of papers on this site.
For example: &quot;On Vortex Atoms&quot;, where he unsuccessfully
tried to build atoms out of knotted electromagnetic field lines, and
wound up giving birth to knot theory.  Some others I hadn't heard of:
&quot;On the origin of life&quot;, &quot;The sorting demon of
Maxwell&quot;, and &quot;Windmills must be the future source of
power&quot;.
 
<P>
Anyway: for over a century the so-called &quot;Kelvin structure&quot;
was believed to be the best solution to the problem of chopping space
into equal volume cells with minimal surface area.  But in 1993 two
physicists at Trinity College in Dublin - Denis Weaire and Robert
Phelan - found a solution that has 0.3% less surface area!  It looks
like this:

11) Wikipedia, Weaire-Phelan structure, 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaire%E2%80%93Phelan_structure">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaire&ndash;Phelan_structure</a>

<P>
It's built from <em>two</em> kinds of cells - a 12-sided one and a
14-sided one.  Was that allowed in Kelvin's original puzzle?  I can't
tell!

<P>
In fact, this so-called &quot;Weaire-Phelan structure&quot; was no
bolt out of the blue.  The basic pattern had already been seen in
certain cage-like crystals called &quot;clathrates&quot;.  For
example, down at the bottom of the ocean there's somewhere between
500 and 2500 billion 
tons of <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_clathrate">methane 
hydrate</a>, a funny substance in which
methane molecules are trapped in polyhedral cages formed by water
molecules.  It looks like ice, but you can ignite it with a cigarette
lighter!  If you think global warming is bad now, just wait until
people figure out how to mine this stuff....

<P>
Anyway, methane hydrate is just one of a collection of gas hydrates
with different geometries.  And it's an example of a &quot;type I&quot; 
gas hydrate, where water molecules form cages patterned after the
Weaire-Phelan structure!

12) Wikipedia, Clathrate hydrate, 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_hydrate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_hydrate</a>

<P>
So, it's nicely appropriate to use the Weaire-Phelan structure for a 
building called the Water Cube.  Since this structure is perfectly 
periodic, the engineer for the Water Cube cut it at an odd angle to 
make it look more exciting.  The MAA article cited above says:

<blockquote>
   Made of a plastic known as ethylene tetrafluoroethylene and 
   filled with air, the bubbles are attached to a steel framework 
   outlining the bubble edges.  Surface tension holds the bubbles 
   together and tends to pull them into a structure with least 
   surface area.

<P>
   The building &quot;really looks like nothing else in the
   world,&quot; Tristam Carfrae told the New York Times. &quot;It's a
   box made of bubbles.&quot; Carfrae is the structural engineer who
   designed the center.
</blockquote>

<P>
On the math side of things, there's plenty left to be done.  Nobody
has proved that the Weaire-Phelan structure is the best solution 
to Kelvin's problem.  According to Frank Morgan, the expert 
on minimal surface who reviewed Spziro's book on Kepler's problem, 

<blockquote>
   Proving the Weaire-Phelan structure optimal looks perhaps a 
   century beyond current mathematics to me, but I understand that 
   Hales is already thinking about it.
</blockquote>

More generally, minimal surface theory is a lively subject that
uses a lot of deep tools.  Morgan is really big on explaining math, 
so his book is probably the place to start if you want to dig deeper:

Personally, I'm more in love with symmetry than minimization.  So, I
want to learn more about the 28 &quot;convex uniform honeycombs&quot;
- ways of uniformly packing 3d space with uniform solids:

<P>
14) Wikipedia, Convex uniform honeycomb, 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_uniform_honeycomb">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_uniform_honeycomb</a>

<P>
They're related to Coxeter groups and &quot;crystallographic
groups&quot;, which are the 3d analogues of the wallpaper groups I
discussed back in &quot;<a href = "week267.html">week267</A>&quot;.
In fact, we can study honeycombs and their symmetry groups in any
dimension, both in flat space and in positively curved (spherical) and
negatively curved (hyperbolic) space.  A lot is known about them....
