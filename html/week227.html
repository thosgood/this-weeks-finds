<TITLE> week227 </TITLE>




<P>
Today I want to say a bit about physics, and then a bit about about 
logic, since that's what I was studying for the last month in Marseille.  
But first, the astronomy pictures of the week:

<P>
On August 4, 2004, the Mars rover called Opportunity took these 
pictures of dunes as it entered Endurance Crater.  The red one is
what we'd actually see; the blue one is a false-color image designed
to bring out certain details.  

<P>
Both images show show tendrils of sand less than 1 meter high stretching 
from the big dunes toward the rover, and some rocks in the foreground.
The false-color image emphasizes accumulations of millimeter-sized spheres 
called &quot;blueberries&quot; on the flat parts of the dunes.  Here's what 
they look like close up:

<P>
2) Mineral in Mars &quot;berries&quot; adds to water story, NASA/JPL,

<P>
Thanks to a M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscope aboard the rover, which studies rocks 
by firing &gamma; rays at them, we know these blueberries contain a lot of 
hematite.   

<P>
Hematite is made of ferric oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 
otherwise known as &quot;rust&quot;.   
It's usually formed in the presence of water.  For this and other
reasons, it's believed that the blueberries in Endurance Crater were
formed when Mars was wetter than today.  An interesting puzzle is whether
they were formed by groundwater leaching ferric oxide from rocks, or
deposited in standing water - for example, a lake.

<P>
It's amazing how much we can learn from unmanned space probes.   And
it's amazing to me how some people want to spend billions on manned
missions.  To read more about what SF writers Larry Niven, Joe Haldeman, 
Greg Bear and other folks including me think about the merits of manned 
versus unmanned space missions, try this:

3) Meme Therapy: Life from a science fiction point of view, 
<A HREF = "http://memetherapy.blogspot.com/2006/03/brain-parade-feature-where-we-pester.html">http://memetherapy.blogspot.com/2006/03/brain-parade-feature-where-we-pester.html</A>

<P>
But enough space stuff... now for some physics!

<P>
A strange thing happened around the 1980s.  Before that, theorists
had been making rapid and revolutionary progress in understanding 
the fundamental laws of physics for almost a century.  They kept
predicting shocking new effects that were soon found in actual
experiments: radio waves, nuclear chain reactions, black holes, 
lasers, antimatter, neutrinos, quarks,... up to and including the 
W and Z bosons.  The power of human thought never seemed greater.

<P>
Since the 1980s, most of the new discoveries in fundamental physics 
have come from unexpected observations in astronomy.  These observations
were mostly <em>not</em> predicted by theorists.  The key examples are: 
dark matter, dark energy, and neutrino oscillations.  The only serious 
counterexamples that come to mind are the top quark, discovered in 
1995, and Alan Guth's inflationary cosmology, dreamt up around 1979
and <em>partially</em> confirmed by recent data - though the jury is still 
out.  

<P>
Theorists are publishing more than ever, but most of their theories 
are either not yet testable (string theory, loop quantum gravity) or 
seem to have been disproved by experiment (grand unified theory 
predictions of proton decay).

<P>
It's interesting to meditate on why this change has happened, what 
it means, and what will happen next.  I spoke about this in Marseille 
shortly before coming home to Riverside.  You can see my slides here:

<P>
4) John Baez, Fundamental physics: where we stand today, lecture at
at the Faculty of Sciences, Luminy, February 27th, 2006, available
at <A HREF = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/where_we_stand/">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/where_we_stand/</A>

<P>
This talk was for nonphysicists, so it's not very technical.  The first
part is a gentle introduction to the laws of physics as we know them.

<P>

5) Varun Sahri, Dark matter and dark energy, available as <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0403324">astro-ph/0403324</A>.

<P>
If you read this, you'll learn about the &quot;cuspy core problem&quot; - 
existing
cold dark matter models produce galaxies with a sharp spikes of high
density near their cores, sharper than observed.  You'll learn about
&quot;quintessence&quot;, a kind of hypothetical field that some people use to 
model dark energy, thus &quot;explaining&quot; the accelerating expansion 
of the universe.  You'll learn about the &quot;Chaplygin gas&quot;, a 
hypothetical substance 
whose properties interpolate between those of cold dark matter and dark
energy.  And, you'll learn about &quot;phantom energy&quot; models of dark 
energy, 
which fit the accelerating expansion of the universe quite nicely now 
but predict a &quot;Big Rip&quot;, in which the expansion rate eventually 
becomes 
<em>infinite</em>. 

<P>
In short, you'll see how people are flailing around trying to understand 
dark matter and dark energy.

<P>
I had a great time in Marseille.  The area around there is great for 
mathematicians.  Algebraists can visit the beautiful nearby city of 
Aix - pronounced &quot;x&quot;.  Logicians will enjoy the dry, dusty island of 
If - pronounced &quot;eef&quot;, just like a French logician would say it.  
And everyone will enjoy the medieval hill town of Les Baux, which looks 
like something out of Escher.  Here's a <A HREF = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/france_2006">picture</A> of it:

<P>
<IMG HEIGHT = 500 WIDTH = 600 SRC = "LesBaux_2006_002.small2.jpg">

<P>
Actually the Chateau D'If, on the island of the same name, is where 
Edmond Dantes was imprisoned in Alexander Dumas' novel &quot;The Count of 
Monte Cristo&quot;.  It's in this formidable fortress that the wise old 
Abbe Faria tells Dantes the location of the treasure that later made 
him rich.  

<P>
I guess everyone except me read this story as a kid - I'm just reading
it now.  But how many of you remember that Faria spent his time in 
prison studying the works of Aristotle?  There's a great scene where 
Dantes asks Faria where he learned so much about logic, and Faria replies: 
&quot;If - and only If!&quot;

<P>
That Dumas guy sure was a joker.

<P>
Luckily I didn't need to be locked up on a deserted island to learn
some logic in Marseille.  There were lots of great talks on this topic
at the conference I attended:

<P>
7) Geometry of Computation 2006 (Geocal06), 
<A HREF = "http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/geocal06/">
http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/geocal06/</A>

<P>
For example, Yves Lafont gave a category-theoretic approach to Boolean
logic gates which explains their relation to Feynman diagrams:

<P>

Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 184 (2003), 257-310.  Also
available at 
<A HREF = "http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~lafont/publications.html">
http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~lafont/publications.html</A>

<P>
and together with Yves Guiraud, Francois Metayer and Albert Burroni,  
he gave a detailed introduction to the homology of n-categories and
its application to rewrite rules.  The idea is to study any sort of
algebraic gadget (like a group) by creating an n-category where the 
objects are &quot;expressions&quot; for elements in the gadget, the morphisms 
are &quot;ways of rewriting expressions&quot; by applying the rules at hand, 
the 2-morphisms are &quot;ways of passing from one way of rewriting 
expressions to another&quot; by applying certain &quot;meta-rules&quot;, 
and so on.  
Then one can use ideas from algebraic topology to study this 
n-category and prove stuff about the original gadget!

<P>
To understand how this actually works, it's best to start with Craig 
Squier's work on the word problem for monoids.  I explained this 
pretty carefully back in &quot;<A HREF = "week70.html">week70</A>&quot; 
when I first heard Lafont lecture 
on this topic - it made a big impression on me!  You can read more here:

<P>
I was also lucky to get some personal tutoring from folks including
Laurent Regnier, Peter Selinger and especially Phil Scott.  Ever since
&quot;<A HREF = "week40.html">week40</A>&quot;, I've been trying to understand something called &quot;linear logic&quot;,
which was invented by Jean-Yves Girard, who teaches in Marseille.  
Thanks to all this tutoring, I think I finally get it!   

<P>
To get a taste of what Phil Scott told me, you should read this:

<P>
Right now, I'm only up to explaining a microscopic portion of this 
stuff.  But since the typical reader of This Week's Finds may know more
about physics than logic, maybe that's good.  In fact, I'll use this
as an excuse to simplify everything tremendously, leaving out all sorts
of details that a real logician would want.

<P>
Logic can be divided into two parts: SYNTAX and SEMANTICS.  Roughly
speaking, syntax concerns the symbols you scribble on the page, 
while semantics concerns what these symbols mean.

<P>
A bit more precisely, imagine some kind of logical system where you 
write down some theory - like the axioms for a group, say - and use
it to prove theorems.  

<P>
In the realm of syntax, we focus on the form our theory is allowed 
to have, and how we can deduce new sentences from old ones.  So, one 
of the key concepts is that of a PROOF.  The details will vary depending 
on the kind of logical system we're studying.  

<P>
In the realm of semantics, we are interested in gadgets that actually
satisfy the axioms in our theory - for example, actual groups, if we're 
thinking about the theory of groups.  Such a gadget is called a MODEL
of the theory.  Again, the details vary immensely. 

<P>
In the realm of syntax, we say a list of axioms X &quot;implies&quot; a 
sentence P if we can prove P from X using some deduction rules, and we write 
this as 

<P>
X |- P

<P>
In the realm of semantics, we say a list of axioms X &quot;entails&quot; a 
sentence P if every model of X is also a model of P, and we write this as

<P>
X |= P

<P>
Syntax and semantics are &quot;dual&quot; in a certain sense - a sense that can
be made very precise if one fixes a specific class of logical systems.
This duality is akin to the usual relation between vector spaces and 
their duals, or more generally groups and their categories of 
representations.  The idea is that given a theory T you can figure 
out its models, which form a category Mod(T) - and conversely, given the 
category of models Mod(T), perhaps with a little extra information, 
you can reconstruct T.  

<P>
A little extra information?  Well, in some cases a model of T will be
a <em>set</em> with some extra structure - for example, if T is the theory of
groups, a model of T will be a group, which is a set equipped with some 
operations.  So, in these cases there's a functor

<P>
U: Mod(T) &rarr; Set 

<P>
assigning each model its underlying set.  And, you can easily reconstruct T
from Mod(T) <em>together</em> with this functor.  

<P>
This idea was worked out by Lawvere for a class of logical systems 
called algebraic theories, which I discussed in 
&quot;<A HREF = "week200.html">week200</A>&quot;.   But, the 
same idea goes by the name of &quot;Tannaka-Krein duality&quot; in a 
different context: a Hopf algebra H has a category of comodules Rep(H), 
which comes equipped with a functor 

<P>
U: Rep(H) &rarr; Vect

<P>
assigning each comodule its underlying vector space.  And, you can 
reconstruct H from Rep(H) together with this functor.  The proof is
even very similar to Lawvere's proof for algebraic theories!

<P>
I gave a bunch of talks in Marseille about algebraic theories, some 
related logical systems called PROPs and PROs, and their relation to 
quantum theory, especially Feynman diagrams:

as <A HREF = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/universal/">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/universal/</A>

<P>
I came mighty close to explaining how to compute the cohomology of
an algebraic theory... and you can read more about that here:

theories, J. Algebra 137 (1991) 253-296.

Baues-Wirsching cohomology of algebraic theories, Max-Planck-Institut 
f&uuml;r Mathematik, preprint series 86 (2005).

<P>
But alas, I didn't get around to talking about the duality between 
syntax and semantics.  For that Lawvere's original thesis is a good
place to go:

Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, 1963.  Also available at
<A HREF = "http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5abs.html">
http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5abs.html</A>

<P>
Anyway, the stuff Phil Scott told me about was mainly over on the
syntax side.  Here categories show up in another way.  Oversimplifying
as usual, the idea is to create a category where an object P is a
<em>sentence</em> - or maybe a list of sentences - and a morphism

<P>
f: P &rarr; Q

<P>
is a <em>proof</em> of Q from P - or maybe an equivalence class of proofs.

<P>
We can compose proofs in a more or less obvious way, so with any 
luck this gives a category!  And, different kinds of logical system 
give us different kinds of categories.  

<P>
Quite famously, the
multiplicative fragment of
intuitionistic logic gives cartesian closed categories.
(The &quot;multiplicative fragment&quot;
is the portion that deals with &quot;and&quot;
and &quot;implies&quot; but leaves out &quot;or&quot; and &quot;not&quot;.
I'm calling it this because &quot;and&quot; acts like multiplication,
while &quot;or&quot; acts like addition.)   
Similarly, 
the multiplicative fragment of linear logic gives *-autonomous 
categories.  
Full-fledged intuitionistic logic gives cartesian closed categories
with finite coproducts, and
full-fledged linear logic gives us even fancier kinds of categories!
If you want to learn about these examples, read the handbook article by 
Phil Scott mentioned above.

<P>
One thing that intrigues me is the equivalence relation we need to get 
a category whose morphisms are equivalence classes of proofs.  In 
Gentzen's &quot;natural deduction&quot; approach to logic, there are various 
deduction rules.  Here's one: 

<PRE>
P |- Q    P |- Q'
------------------
  P |- Q &amp; Q'
</PRE>

This says that if P implies Q and it also implies Q', then it 
implies Q &amp; Q'.   

<P>
Here's another:

<PRE>
P |- Q =&gt; R
------------
P and Q |- R
</PRE>
And here's a very important one, called the &quot;cut rule&quot;:

<PRE>
P |- Q    Q |- R
-----------------
     P |- R
</PRE>
If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R!

<P>
There are a bunch more... and to get the game rolling we need
to start with this:

<PRE>
P |- P
</PRE>
In this setup, a proof f: P &rarr; Q looks vaguely like this:

<PRE>
    f-crud
    f-crud
    f-crud
    f-crud
    f-crud
    f-crud
 -------------
    P |- Q 
</PRE>
The stuff I'm calling &quot;f-crud&quot; is a bunch of steps which use the
deduction rules to get to P |- Q.  

<P>
Suppose we also we also have a proof

<P>
g: Q &rarr; R

<P>
There's a way to stick f and g together to get a proof

<P>
fg: P &rarr; R

<P>
This proof consists of setting the proofs f and g side by side and then
using the cut rule to finish the job.  So, fg looks like this:

<PRE>
     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud
    --------   --------
     P |- Q     Q |- R
   ---------------------
           P |- R 
</PRE>
Now let's see if composition is associative.  Suppose we also have a 
proof

<P>
h: R &rarr; S

<P>
We can form proofs

<P>
(fg)h: P &rarr; S

<P>
and

<P>
f(gh): P &rarr; S 

<P>
Are they equal?  No!  The first one looks like this:


<PRE>

     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud
     f-crud     g-crud       h-crud
     f-crud     g-crud       h-crud
    --------   --------      h-crud
     P |- Q     Q |- R       h-crud
   ---------------------   ----------- 
           P |- R            R |- S 
         ----------------------------
                    P |- S

</PRE>
while the second one looks like this:


<PRE>

                g-crud       h-crud
                g-crud       h-crud
    f-crud      g-crud       h-crud
    f-crud      g-crud       h-crud
    f-crud     --------     --------      
    f-crud      Q |- R       R |- S      
   ---------   --------------------- 
    P |- Q            Q |- S 
   ----------------------------
            P |- S

</PRE>
So, they're not quite equal!  This is one reason we need an 
equivalence relation on proofs to get a category.  Both proofs 
resemble trees, but the first looks more like this:

<PRE>
\  /  /
 \/  /
  \ /
   |
</PRE>
while the second looks more like this:

<PRE>
\  \  /
 \  \/
  \ /
   |
</PRE>
So, we need an equivalence relation that identifies these proofs
if we want composition to be associative! 

<P>
This sort of idea, including this &quot;tree&quot; business, is very familiar 
from homotopy theory, where we need a similar equivalence relation if we
want composition of paths to be associative.  But in homotopy theory, 
people have learned that it's often better NOT to impose an equivalence 
relation on paths!  Instead, it's better to form a <em>weak 2-category</em> 
of paths, where there's a 2-morphism going from this sort of composite:

<PRE>
\  /  /
 \/  /
  \ /
   |
</PRE>
to this one:

<PRE>
\  \  /
 \  \/
  \ /
   |
</PRE>

This is called the &quot;associator&quot;.  In our logic context, we can 
think of 
the associator as a way to transform one proof into another.  

<P>
The associator should satisfy an equation called 
the &quot;pentagon identity&quot;,
which I explained back in &quot;<A HREF = "week144.html">week144</A>&quot;.  
However, it will only do this if
we let 2-morphisms be <em>equivalence classes</em> of proof transformations.

<P>
So, there's a kind of infinite regress here.  To deal with this, it
would be best to work with a &quot;weak &omega;-category&quot; with

<P>
sentences (or sequences of sentences) as objects, <br>
proofs as morphisms, <br>
proof transformations as 2-morphisms, <br>
transformations of proof transformations as 3-morphisms,... <br>
<P>

and so on.   With this, we would never need any equivalence relations:
we keep track of all transformations explicitly.  This is almost beyond 
what mathematicians are capable of at present, but it's clearly a good 
thing to strive toward.

<P>
So far, it seems Seely has gone the furthest in this direction.
In his thesis, way back in 1977, he studied what one might call &quot;weak 
cartesian closed 2-categories&quot; arising from proof theory.  You can read 
an account of this work here:

<P>
Can we go all the way and cook up some sort of &omega;-category of proofs?  
Interestingly,
while the logicians at Geocal06 were talking about n-categories and
the geometry of proofs, the mathematician Vladimir Voevodsky was giving
some talks at Stanford about something that sounds pretty similar:

<P>
17) Vladimir Voevodsky, lectures on homotopy &lambda; calculus, 
notice at <A HREF = "http://math.stanford.edu/distinguished_voevodsky.htm">http://math.stanford.edu/distinguished_voevodsky.htm</A>  

<P>
Voevodsky has thought hard about n-categories, and he won the 
Fields medal for his applications of homotopy theory to algebraic 
geometry.  

<P>
The typed &lambda; calculus is another way of thinking about intuitionistic 
logic - or in other words, cartesian closed categories of proofs.  The 
&quot;homotopy &lambda; calculus&quot; should thus be something similar, but where 
we keep track of transformations between proofs, transformations
between transformations between proofs... and so on ad infinitum.

<P>
But that's just my guess!  Is this what Voevodsky is talking about???
I haven't managed to get anyone to tell me.  Maybe I'll email him and ask.

<P>
There were a lot of other cool talks at Geocal06, like Girard's talk
on applications of von Neumann algebras (especially the hyperfinite 
type II<sub>1</sub> 
factor!) in logic, and Peter Selinger's talk on the category of
completely positive maps, diagrammatic methods for dealing with these
maps, and their applications to quantum logic:

<P>
But, I want to finish writing this and go out and have some waffles
for my Sunday brunch.  So, I'll stop here!

and Peter McBurney for corrections.
Jeffrey Winkler points out that &quot;hematite&quot; got its name 
from the Greek word for &quot;blood&quot; because the ancient Greeks
thought these rocks marked the locations of battles where
the blood of warriors had soaked into the rocks.  This is appropriate,
since Mars is the god of war!

An anonymous correspondent had this to say 
about the &quot;homotopy &lambda; calculus&quot;:

<blockquote>
 Several years ago, Kontsevich explained
 to me an idea he had about "homotopy proof theory" (or model theory, or
 logic, ...).  As soon as I saw Voevodsky's abstract it reminded me of
 what Kontsevich said; perhaps it's a well-known idea in the
 Russian-Fields-medallist club.  Somewhere I have notes from what
 Kontsevich said, but as far as I remember it went roughly like this.  
 
<P>
 In certain set-ups (such as Martin-L&ouml;f type theory) every statement
 carries a proof of itself.  Of course, a statement may have many proofs.
 If we imagine that all the statements are of the form "A = B", then what
 we're saying is that every equals sign carries with it a <em>reason</em> for
 equality, or proof of equality.  If I remember rightly, Kontsevich's
 idea was to do a topological analogue, so that every term (like A and B)
 is assigned a point in some fixed space, and equalities of terms induce
 paths between points.  There was more, pushing the idea further, but I
 forget what.
