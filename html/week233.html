<P>
On Tuesday I'm supposed to talk with Lee Smolin about an idea he's
been working on with Fotini Markopoulou and Sundance Bilson-Thompson.
This idea relates the elementary particles in one generation of the 
Standard Model to certain 3-strand framed braids:

<P>

preons, available as <A HREF =
"http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0503213">hep-ph/0503213</A>.

<P>
2) Sundance O. Bilson-Thompson, Fotini Markopoulou, and Lee Smolin, 
Quantum gravity and the Standard Model, <A HREF = "http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0603022">hep-th/0603022</A>.
 
<P>
It's a very speculative idea: they've found some interesting relations, 
but nobody knows if these are coincidental or not.  

<P>
Luckily, one of my hobbies is collecting mysterious relationships between
basic mathematical objects and trying to figure out what's going on.
So, I already happen to know a bunch of weird facts about 3-strand braids.  
I figure I'll tell Smolin about this stuff.  But if you don't mind, I'll 
practice on you!  

<P>
So, today I'll try to tell a story connecting the 3-strand braid group, 
the trefoil knot, rational tangles, the groups SL(2,Z) and PSL(2,Z), 
conformal field theory, and Monstrous Moonshine.  

<P>
I've talked about some of these things before, but now I'll introduce
some new puzzle pieces, which come from two places:

<P>
3) Imre Tuba and Hans Wenzl, Representations of the braid group B<sub>3</sub>
and of SL(2,Z), available as <A HREF =

<A HREF = "http://arxiv.org/abs/math.NT/0512248">math.NT/0512248</A>.

<P>
You could call it &quot;a tale of two groups&quot;.

<P>
On the one hand, the 3-strand braid group has generators 

<PRE>
     |   |   |
      \ /    |
A  =   /     |
      / \    |
     |   |   |
</PRE>
and

<PRE>
     |   |   |   
     |    \ /    
B =  |     /    
     |    / \  
     |   |   |
</PRE>
and the only relation is

<P>
ABA = BAB

<P>
otherwise known as the &quot;third Reidemeister move&quot;:

<PRE>
|   |  |         |  |   | 
 \ /   |         |   \ /
  /    |         |    / 
 / \   |         |   / \
|   \ /           \ /   |  
|    /      =      /    | 
|   / \           / \   | 
 \ /   |         |   \ / 
  /    |         |    /
 / \   |         |   / \  
</PRE>
On other hand, the group SL(2,Z) consists of 2&times;2 integer matrices with
determinant 1.  It's important in number theory, complex analysis,
string theory and other branches of pure mathematics.  I've described
some of its charms in &quot;<A HREF =
"week125.html">week125</A>&quot;, &quot;<A HREF =
"week229.html">week229</A>&quot; and elsewhere.

<P>
These groups look pretty different at first.  But, there's a 
homomorphism from B<sub>3</sub> onto SL(2,Z)!  It goes like this:

<PRE>
        1   1
A |-&gt;  
        0   1


        1   0
B |-&gt;  
       -1   1
</PRE>

Both these matrices describe &quot;shears&quot; in the plane.  
You may enjoy drawing these shears and visualizing the equation 
ABA = BAB in these terms.  I did.

<P>
I would like to understand this better... and here are some clues.

<P>
The center of B<sub>3</sub> is generated by the element (AB)<sup>3</sup>.  
This element corresponds to a &quot;full twist&quot;.  In other words, it's
the braid you get by hanging 3 strings from the ceiling, grabbing 
them all with one hand at the bottom, and giving them a full 360-degree 
twist:

<PRE>
|   |  |  
 \ /   | 
  /    |       A
 / \   |
|   \ /    
|    /         B 
|   / \   
 \ /   | 
  /    |       A
 / \   |
|   \ /    
|    /         B 
|   / \   
 \ /   | 
  /    |       A
 / \   |
|   \ /    
|    /         B 
|   / \   
|  |   |
</PRE>
This full twist gets sent to -1 in SL(2,Z):

<PRE>
             -1   0 
(AB)<sup>3</sup> |-&gt;  
              0  -1
</PRE>
So, the double twist gets sent to the identity:

<PRE>
             1   0 
(AB)<sup>6</sup> |-&gt;  
             0   1
</PRE>
In fact, Tuba and Wenzl say the double twist <em>generates</em> the
kernel of our homomorphism from B<sub>3</sub> to SL(2,Z).  So, SL(2,Z)
is isomorphic to the group of 3-strand braids modulo double twists!

<P>
This reminds me of spinors... since you have to twist an electron 
around <em>twice</em> to get its wavefunction back to where it started.   
And indeed, SL(2,Z) is a subgroup of SL(2,C), which is the double 
cover of the Lorentz group.  So, 3-strand braids indeed act on the 
state space of a spin-1/2 particle, with double twists acting 
trivially!

<P>
(For more on this, check out Trautman's work on &quot;Pythagorean
spinors&quot; in &quot;<A HREF = "week196.html">week196</A>&quot;.
There's also a version where we use integers mod 7, described in
&quot;<A HREF = "week219.html">week219</A>&quot;.)

<P>
If instead we take 3-strand braids modulo full twists, we get the 
so-called &quot;modular group&quot;:

<P>
PSL(2,Z) = SL(2,Z)/{+-1}

<P>
Now, SL(2,Z) is famous for being the &quot;mapping class group&quot;
of the torus - that is, the group of orientation-preserving
diffeomorphisms, modulo diffeomorphisms connected to the identity.
Similary, PSL(2,Z) is famous for acting on the rational numbers
together with a point at infinity by means of fractional linear
transformations:

<PRE>
         az + b
z |-&gt;   -------
         cz + d
</PRE>

where a,b,c,d are integers and ad-bc = 1.  The group PSL(2,Z) also
acts on certain 2-strand tangles called &quot;rational tangles&quot;.
In &quot;<A HREF = "week229.html">week229</A>&quot;, I told a nice
story I heard from Michael Hutchings, explaining how these three facts
fit together in a neat package.
 
<P>

But now let's combine those facts with the stuff I just said!  Since
PSL(2,Z) acts on rational tangles, and there's a homomorphism from
B<sub>3</sub> to PSL(2,Z), 3-strand braids must act on rational
tangles.  How does that go?

<P>
There's an obvious guess, or two, or three, or four, but let's just
work it out.

<P>
I just said that the 3-strand braid A gets mapped to this shear:

<PRE>
        1   1
A |-&gt;  
        0   1
</PRE>
In &quot;<A HREF = "week229.html">week229</A>&quot; I said what this
shear does to a rational tangle.  It gives it a 180 degree twist at
the bottom, like this:

<PRE>
  |   |                |   |
  |   |                |   |
  |   |                |   |
 -------              -------
 |  T  |   |----&gt;     |  T  |        
 -------              -------
  |   |                 \ /
  |   |                  / 
  |   |                 / \
</PRE>
Next, Tuba and Wenzl point out that

<PRE>
                  0   1
ABA = BAB |-&gt; 
                 -1   0
</PRE>

which is a quarter turn.  From &quot;<A HREF =
"week229.html">week229</A>&quot; you can see how this quarter turn
acts on a rational tangle:

<PRE>
  |   |                       |     | 
  |   |              ____     |     |
  |   |             /     \   |     |
 -------           |     -------    |
 |  T  |   |----&gt;  |     |  T  |    |    
 -------           |     -------    |
  |   |            |      |   \____/
  |   |            |      |    
  |   |            |      |  
</PRE>
It gives it a quarter turn!      

<P>
From these facts, we can figure out what the braid B does to a 
rational tangle.  So, let me do the calculation.  

<P>
Scribble, scribble, curse and scribble.... Eureka!

<P>
Since we know what A does, and what ABA does, we can figure out 
what B must do.  But, to make the answer look cute, I needed a 
sneaky fact about rational tangles, which is that A <em>also</em> acts 
like this:

<PRE>
  |   |                 \ / 
  |   |                  /
  |   |                 / \ 
 -------              -------
 |  T  |   |----&gt;     |  T  |        
 -------              -------
  |   |                |   |
  |   |                |   | 
  |   |                |   |
</PRE>
This is proved in Goldman and Kauffman's paper cited in &quot;<A HREF = "week228.html">week228</A>&quot;.
With the help of this, I can show B acts like this:

<PRE>
  |   |              |          |
  |   |              |   ___    |
  |   |              |  /   \   |
 -------             | /    -------   
 |  T  |   |----&gt;     \     |  T  |  
 -------             / \    ------- 
  |   |             |   \___/   | 
  |   |             |           | 
  |   |             |           |
</PRE>
And this is <em>great!</em>  It means our action of 3-strand braids on 
rational tangles is really easy to describe.  Just take your tangle
and let the upper left strand dangle down:

<PRE>
           |
   ____    |               
  /    \   |              
 |    -------           
 |    |  T  |   
 |    -------  
 |     |   |  
 |     |   | 
 |     |   |
</PRE>
To let a 3-strand braid act on this, just attach it to the bottom of
the picture!   

<P>
(That's why there were <em>four</em> obvious guesses about this would work:
one can easily imagine four variations on this trick, depending on 
which strand is the &quot;odd man out&quot; - here it's the upper right.  It's
just a matter of convention which we use, but my conventions give this.)

<P>
In fact, even the group of 4-strand braids acts on rational tangles in 
an obvious way, but the 3-strand braid group is enough for now.

<P>
Let me summarize.  
The 3-strand braid group B<sub>3</sub> acts on rational tangles
in an obvious way.  The subgroup that acts trivially is precisely the 
center of B<sub>3</sub>, generated by the full twist.  
Using stuff from &quot;<A HREF = "week229.html">week229</A>&quot;, 
it follows that the quotient of B<sub>3</sub> by its center acts 
on the projectivized 
rational homology of the torus.  We thus get a topological explanation 
of why B<sub>3</sub> mod its center is PSL(2,Z).

<P>
But there's more.

<P>
For starters, the 3-strand braid group is also the fundamental group of 
S<sup>3</sup> minus the trefoil knot!

<P>
And, S<sup>3</sup> minus the trefoil knot is secretly the same as
SL(2,R)/SL(2,Z)!

<P>
In fact, Terry Gannon writes that the 3-strand braid group can be
regarded as &quot;the universal central extension of the modular
group, and the universal symmetry of its modular forms&quot;.  I'm not
completely sure what that means, but here's <em>part</em> of what it
means.

<P>
Just as PSL(2,C) is the Lorentz group in 4d spacetime, PSL(2,R) is the 
Lorentz group in 3d spacetime.  This group has a double cover SL(2,R), 
which shows up when you study spinors.  But, it also has a universal 
cover, which shows up when you study anyons.  The universal cover has
infinitely many sheets.   And up in this universal cover, sitting over 
the subgroup SL(2,Z), we get... the 3-strand braid group!

<P>
In math jargon, we have this commutative diagram where the
rows are short exact sequences:


<PRE>
    1 ----&gt; Z -----&gt; B<sub>3</sub> -------&gt; SL(2,Z) ----&gt; 1

            |        |             |          
            |        |             |         
            v        v             v        

    1 ----&gt; Z ---&gt; SL(2,R)<sup>~</sup> ---&gt; SL(2,R) ----&gt; 1
</PRE>
 
Here SL(2,R)<sup>~</sup> is the universal cover of SL(2,R).
Since &pi;<sub>1</sub>(SL(2,R)) = Z, this is a Z-fold cover.
You can describe this cover explicitly using the Maslov index, 
which is a formula that actually computes an integer for any loop 
in SL(2,R), or indeed any symplectic group.  

<P>
But anyway, fiddling around with this diagram and the long exact
sequence of homotopy groups for a fibration, you can show that indeed:

<P>
&pi;<sub>1</sub>(SL(2,R)/SL(2,Z)) = B<sub>3</sub>.

<P>
This also follows from the fact that 
SL(2,R)/SL(2,Z) looks like S<sup>3</sup> minus a trefoil.

<P>
Gannon believes that number theorists should think about all this stuff,
since he thinks it's lurking behind that weird network of ideas called
Monstrous Moonshine (see &quot;<A HREF = "week66.html">week66</A>&quot;).

<P>
And here's the basic reason why.  I'll try to get this right....

<P>
Any rational conformal field theory has a &quot;chiral algebra&quot; A which 
acts
on the left-moving states.  Mathematicians call this sort of thing a
&quot;vertex operator algebra&quot;.  A representation of this on some vector
space V is a space of states for the circle in some &quot;sector&quot; of our
theory.  Let's pick some state v in V.   Then we can define a 
&quot;one-point function&quot; where we take a Riemann surface with little 
disk cut out and insert this state on the boundary.  This is a number,
essentially the amplitude for a string in the give state to evolve like 
this Riemann surface says. 

<P>
In fact, instead of chopping out a little disk it's nice to just
remove a point - a &quot;puncture&quot;, they call it.  But, we get an ambiguous
answer unless we pick coordinates at this point, or in the lingo of
complex analysis, a choice of &quot;uniforming parameter&quot;.  Then our
one-point function becomes a function on the moduli space of Riemann
surfaces equipped with a puncture and a choice of uniformizing parameter.

<P>
If we didn't have this uniformizing parameter to worry about, we'd
just have the moduli space of tori equipped with a marked point, 
which is nothing but the usual moduli space of elliptic curves,

<P>
H/PSL(2,Z)

<P>
where H is the complex upper halfplane.  Then our one-point function
would have nice transformation properties under PSL(2,Z).  

<P>
But, with this uniformizing parameter to worry about, our one-point 
function only has nice transformation properties under B<sub>3</sub>.  This 
is somehow supposed to be related to how B<sub>3</sub> is the &quot;universal
central extension&quot; of PSL(2,Z): in conformal field theory, all sorts
of naive symmetries hold only up to a phase, so you have to replace
various groups by central extensions thereof... and here that's what's 
happening to PSL(2,Z)!

<P>
That last paragraph was pretty vague.  If I'm going to understand this
better, either someone has to help me or I've got to read something
like this:

<P>
5) Yongchang Zhu, Modular invariance of characters of vertex operator algebras,
J. Amer. Math. Soc 9 (1996), 237-302.  Also available at
<A HREF = "http://www.ams.org/jams/1996-9-01/S0894-0347-96-00182-8/home.html">http://www.ams.org/jams/1996-9-01/S0894-0347-96-00182-8/home.html</A>

<P>

But I shouldn't need any conformal field theory to see how the moduli
space of punctured tori with uniformizing parameter is related to the
3-strand braid group!  I bet this moduli space is X/B<sub>3</sub> for
some space X, or something like that.  There's something simple at the
bottom of all this, I'm sure.

<P>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Addenda:</B>  Another relation between the trefoil and
the punctured torus: the trefoil has genus 1, meaning that
it bounds a torus minus a disc embedded in R<sup>3</sup>.
You can see this in the lecture &quot;Genus and knot sum&quot; in 
this course on knot theory:

<P>
6) Brian Sanderson, The knot theory MA3F2 page, 
<A HREF = ""http://www.maths.warwick.ac.uk/~bjs/MA3F2-page.html">http://www.maths.warwick.ac.uk/~bjs/MA3F2-page.html</A>

<P>
This course also has material on rational tangles.

<P>
The fact that B<sub>3</sub> is a central extension of
PSL(2,Z) by Z, and the quantum-mechanical interpretation of
a central extension in terms of phases, plays an important role
here:


<P>
7) R. Voituriez, Random walks on the braid group B<sub>3</sub> 
and magnetic translations in hyperbolic geometry, Nucl. Phys. B621 
(2002), 675-688.  Also available as 
<A HREF = "http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0103008">http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0103008</A>.

<P>
Among other things, he points out that the homomorphism
B<sub>3</sub> &rarr; SL(2,Z) described above is the &quot;Burau
representation&quot; of B<sub>3</sub> evaluated at t = 1.
In general, the Burau representation of B<sub>3</sub> is given 
by:

<PRE>
        t   1
A |-&gt;  
        0   1


        1   0
B |-&gt;  
       -t   t
</PRE>
(Conventions differ, and this may not be the best, but it's
the one he uses.)  The Burau representation can also be used
to define a knot invariant called the Alexander polynomial.  
I believe that with some work, one can use this to explain
why Conway could calculate the rational number associated to a
rational tangle in terms of the ratio of Alexander polynomials of two
links associated to it, called its &quot;numerator&quot; and
&quot;denominator&quot;.  In fact he computed this ratio of
polynomials and then evaluate it at a special value of t - 
presumably the same special value we're seeing here (modulo
differences in convention).

<P>
Another issue: I wrote

<blockquote>
For starters, the 3-strand braid group is also the fundamental group of 
S<sup>3</sup> minus the trefoil knot!

<P>
And, S<sup>3</sup> minus the trefoil knot is secretly the same as
SL(2,R)/SL(2,Z)!
</blockquote>

The first one is pretty easy to see; you start with the &quot;Wirtinger 
presentation&quot; of the fundamental group of S<sup>3</sup> minus a 
trefoil, and show by a fun little calculation that this isomorphic to the 
braid group on 3 strands.  A more conceptual proof would be very nice, though.
(See &quot;<a href = "week261.html">week261</a>&quot; for such a proof -
and much more on all this stuff.)

<P>
What about the second one?  Why is  S<sup>3</sup> minus the trefoil knot 
diffeomorphic
to SL(2,R)/SL(2,Z)?   Terry Gannon says so in his paper above, but doesn't
say why.  Some people asked about this, and eventually some people found
some explanations.  First of all, there's a proof on page 84 of this book:

<P>
8) John Milnor, Introduction to Algebraic K-theory, Annals of Math.
Studies 72, Princeton U. Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1971.

<P>
Milnor credits it to Quillen.  Joe Christy summarizes it below.  I
can't tell if this proof is essentially the same as another sketched
below by Swiatoslaw Gal, which exhibits a diffeomorphism using
functions called the Eisenstein series g<sub>2</sub> and
g<sub>3</sub>.  They are probably quite similar arguments.

<P>
Joe Christy writes:

<blockquote>
  I wouldn't be surprised if this was known to Seifert in the 30's,
  though I can't lay my hands on Seifert &amp; Threfall at the moment to
  check. Likewise for Hirzebruch, Brieskorn, Pham & Milnor in the 60's in
  relation to singularities of complex hypersurfaces and exotic spheres.
  When I was learning topology in the 80's it was considered a warm up
  case of Thurston's Geometrization Program - the trefoil knot complement
  has PSL(2,R) geometric structure.

<P>
  In any case, peruse Milnor's Annals of Math Studies for concrete
  references. There is a (typically) elegant proof on p.84 of
  &quot;Introduction to Algebraic K-theory&quot; [study 72], which Milnor credits 
  to Quillen. It contains the missing piece of John's argument:
  introducing the Weierstrass P-function and remarking that the
  differential equation that it satisfies gives the diffeomorphism to
  S<sup>3</sup>-trefoil as the boundary of the pair (discriminant of diff-eq, 
  C<sup>2</sup> = (P,P')-space).

<P>
  This point of view grows out of some observations of Zariski, fleshed
  out in &quot;Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces&quot; [study 61]. The
  geometric viewpoint is made explicit in the paper &quot;On the Brieskorn
  Manifolds M(p,q,r)&quot; in &quot;Knots, Groups, and 3-manifolds&quot; [study 84].

<P>
  It is also related to the intermediate case between the classical
  Platonic solids and John's favorite Platonic surface - the

  In fact the isomorphism is a part of the modular theory:

  f: GL(2,R)/SL(2,Z) &rarr; C<sup>2</sup> - {x<sup>2</sup>=y<sup>3</sup>}
  <P>

  (there is an obvious action of R+ on both sides:
  <P>
 M |&rarr; tM for M in  GL(2,R),<br>
  x |&rarr; t<sup>6</sup> x, <br> y |&rarr; t<sup>4</sup> y,
<P>
   and the quotient is what we want).

  <P>
  GL(2,R)/SL(2,Z) is a space of lattices in C.
  Such a lattice L has classical invariants

  <P>
  g<sub>2</sub>(L) =  60 sum_{z in L'} z<sup>-4</sup>, 

  <P>
  and

  <P>
   g<sub>3</sub>(L) = 140 sum_{z in L'} z<sup>-6</sup>,
  
  <P>
  where L'=L-{0}

  <P>
  The modular theory asserts that:

  <P>
  1. For every pain (g<sub>2</sub>,g<sub>3</sub>) there exist a
     lattice L such that g<sub>2</sub>(L) = g<sub>2</sub> and
     g<sub>3</sub>(L) = g<sub>3</sub> provided that
     g<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> is not equal to
     27g<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>.
  <P>
  2. Such a lattice is unique.

The quantity g<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> - 27
g<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> is called the &quot;discriminant&quot; of the
lattice L, and vanishes as the lattice squashes down to being
degenerate, i.e. a discrete subgroup of C with one rather than two
generators.
