<TITLE>week253</TITLE>




<P>
Yay!  Classes are over!  Soon I'm going to Paris for three weeks, to
talk with Paul-Andr&eacute; Melli&egrave;s 
about logic, games and category theory.
But right now I'm in a vacation mood.  So, I want to take a break from 
the Tale of Groupoidification, and mention some thoughts prompted by the
work of Garrett Lisi:

<P>
1) Garrett Lisi, Deferential Geometry, 
<a href = "http://deferentialgeometry.org/">http://deferentialgeometry.org</a>.

<P>
Garrett is a cool dude who likes to ponder physics while living a
low-budget, high-fun lifestyle: hanging out in Hawaii, surfing, and
stuff like that.  He recently won a Foundational Questions Institute
award to think about ways to unify particle physics and gravity.  That's
an institute devoted precisely to risky endeavors like this.

<P>
Lately he's been visiting California.  So, before giving a talk at
Loops '07 - a loop quantum gravity conference taking place in Mexico
this week - he stopped by Riverside to explain what he's been up to.

<P>
Briefly, he's been trying to explain the 3 generations of elementary
particles using some math called &quot;triality&quot;, which is
related to the octonions and the exceptional Lie groups.  In fact,
he's trying to use the exceptional Lie group E8 to describe all the
particles in the Standard Model, together with gravity.

<P>
I'd like to know if these ideas hold water.  So, I should try to
explain them!  But as usual, in this Week's Finds I'll wind up
explaining not what Garrett actually did, but what it made me think
about.

<P>
For a long time, people have been seeking connections between the
messy pack of particles that populate the Standard Model and
structures that seem beautiful and &quot;inevitable&quot;. 

<P>
A fascinating step in this direction was the SU(5) grand unified
theory proposed in 1975 by Georgi and Glashow.  So, I'll start by
summarizing that... and then explain how exceptional Lie groups might
get involved in this game.

<P>
What people usually call the gauge group of the Standard Model:

<P>
SU(3) &times; SU(2) &times; U(1)

<P>
actually has a bit of flab in it: there's a normal subgroup that acts
trivially on all known particles.  This subgroup is isomorphic to Z/6.
If we mod out by this, we get the &quot;true&quot; gauge group of the
Standard Model:

<P>
G = (SU(3) &times; SU(2) &times; U(1))/(Z/6)

<P>
And, this turns out to have a neat description.  It's isomorphic to the 
subgroup of SU(5) consisting of matrices like this:

<PRE>
(g 0) 
(0 h)
</PRE>

where g is a 3&times;3 block and h is a 2&times;2 block.  For obvious
reasons, I call this group

<P>
S(U(3) &times; U(2))

<P>
If you want some intuition for this, think of the 3&times;3 block as
related to the strong force, and the 2&times;2 block as related to the
electroweak force.  A 3&times;3 matrix can mix up the 3
&quot;colors&quot; that quarks come in - red, green, and blue - and
that's what the strong force is all about.  Similarly, a 2&times;2 matrix
can mix up the 2 &quot;isospins&quot; that quarks and leptons come in
- up and down - and that's part of what the electroweak force is
about.

<P>
If this isn't enough to make you happy, go back to &quot;<A HREF =
"week119.html">week119</A>&quot;, where I reviewed the Standard Model
and its relation to the SU(5) grand unified theory.  If even that
isn't enough to make you happy, try this:

<P>
2) John Baez, Elementary particles, 
<a href = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-spring2003/elementary/">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-spring2003/elementary/</a>

<P>
Okay - I'll assume that one way or another, you're happy with the
idea of S(U(3) &times; U(2)) as the true gauge group of the Standard Model!
Maybe you understand it, maybe you're just willing to nod your head
and accept it.

<P>
Now, the fermions of the Standard Model form a very nice
representation of this group.  SU(5) has an obvious representation on
C<sup>5</sup>, via matrix multiplication.  So, it gets a
representation on the exterior algebra &Lambda;(C<sup>5</sup>).  If we
restrict this from SU(5) to S(U(3) &times; U(2)), we get precisely the
representation of the true gauge group of the Standard Model on one
generation of fermions and their antiparticles!

<P>
This really seems like a miracle when you first see it.  All sorts of
weird numbers need to work out exactly right for this trick to succeed.
For example, it's crucial that quarks have charges 2/3 and -1/3, while 
leptons have charges 0 and -1.  One gets the feeling, pondering this stuff,
that there really is some truth to the SU(5) grand unified theory.

<P>
To give you just a little taste of what's going on, let me show you
how the exterior algebra &Lambda;(C<sup>5</sup>) corresponds to one
generation of fermions and their antiparticles.  For simplicity I'll
use the first generation, since the other two work just the same:

<PRE>
&Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;left-handed antineutrino&gt;

&Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;right-handed down quark&gt; &oplus;  
         &lt;right-handed positron, right-handed antineutrino&gt;

&Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;left-handed up antiquark&gt; &oplus; 
         &lt;left-handed up quark, left-handed down quark&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;left-handed positron&gt;

&Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;right-handed electron&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;right-handed up antiquark, right-handed down antiquark&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;right-handed up quark&gt; 

&Lambda;<sup>4</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;left-handed up antiquark&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;left-handed electron, left-handed neutrino&gt;    

&Lambda;<sup>5</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;right-handed neutrino&gt;
</PRE>

All the quarks and antiquarks come in 3 colors, which I haven't
bothered to list here.  Each space &Lambda;<sup>p</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) is an
irreducible representation of SU(5), but most of these break up into
several different irreducible representations of S(U(3) &times; U(2)),
which are listed as separate rows in the chart above.

<P>
If you're curious how this &quot;breaking up&quot; works, let me explain - it's
sort of pretty.  We just use the splitting

<P>
C<sup>5</sup> &cong; C<sup>3</sup> &oplus; C<sup>2</sup>

<P>
to chop the spaces &Lambda;<sup>p</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) into pieces.   

<P>
To see how this works, remember that
&Lambda;<sup>p</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) is just the vector space analogue
of the binomial coefficient &quot;5 choose p&quot;.  A basis of
C<sup>5</sup> consists of 5 things, and the p-element subsets give a
basis for &Lambda;<sup>p</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>).

<P>
In our application to physics, these 5 things consist of 3 &quot;colors&quot;
- red, green and blue - and 2 &quot;isospins&quot; - up and down.  This gives 
various possible options.

<P>
For example, suppose we want a basis of
&Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>).  Then we need to pick 3 things
out of 5.  We can do this in various ways:

<ul>
<li>
We can pick 3 colors and no isospins - there's just one way to do that.  
</li>
<li>
We can pick 2 colors and 1 isospin - there are six ways to do that.  
</li>
<li>
Or, we can pick 1 color and 2 isospins - there are three ways to do that.
</li>
</ul>
<P>
So, in terms of binomial coefficients, we have

<PRE>
(5 choose 3) = (3 choose 3)(2 choose 0) +
               (3 choose 2)(2 choose 1) +
               (3 choose 1)(2 choose 2)

             = 1 + 6 + 3 

             = 10
</PRE>
<P>
In terms of vector spaces we have:

<PRE>
&Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &oplus; 
         &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &oplus;
         &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>)
</PRE>
<P>
Taking dimensions of these vector spaces, we get 10 = 1 + 6 + 3.  Finally,
in terms of the SU(5) grand unified theory, we get this: 

<PRE>
&Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) = &lt;right-handed electron&gt; &oplus; 
         &lt;right-handed up antiquark, right-handed down antiquark&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;right-handed up quark&gt; 
</PRE>
If we play this game for all the spaces &Lambda;<sup>p</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>), here's what we get:

<PRE>
&Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>)

&Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &oplus;
         &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>)

&Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &oplus;
         &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &oplus;
         &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>)

&Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &oplus;
         &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &oplus;
         &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) 

&Lambda;<sup>4</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &oplus;
         &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>)

&Lambda;<sup>5</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>3</sup>) &otimes; &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>2</sup>)
</PRE>

If we interpret this in terms of physics, we get back our previous chart:
<PRE>
&Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;left-handed antineutrino&gt;

&Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;right-handed down quark&gt; &oplus;  
         &lt;right-handed positron, right-handed antineutrino&gt;

&Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;left-handed up antiquark&gt; &oplus; 
         &lt;left-handed up quark, left-handed down quark&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;left-handed positron&gt;

&Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;right-handed electron&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;right-handed up antiquark, right-handed down antiquark&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;right-handed up quark&gt; 

&Lambda;<sup>4</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;left-handed up antiquark&gt; &oplus;
         &lt;left-handed electron, left-handed neutrino&gt;    

&Lambda;<sup>5</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; &lt;right-handed neutrino&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Now, all this is really cool - but in fact, even before inventing the 
SU(5) theory, Georgi went a bit further, and unified all the left-handed 
fermions above into one irreducible representation of a somewhat bigger 
group: Spin(10).  This is the double cover of the group SO(10), which 
describes rotations in 10 dimensions.

<P>
If you look at the chart above, you'll see the left-handed fermions
live in the even grades of the exterior algebra of C<sup>5</sup>:

<P>
&Lambda;<sup>even</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) = &Lambda;<sup>0</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &oplus; &Lambda;<sup>2</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &oplus; &Lambda;<sup>4</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>)

<P>
This big space forms something called the left-handed Weyl spinor
representation of Spin(10).  It's an irreducible representation.

<P>
Similarly, the right-handed fermions live in the odd grades:

<P>
&Lambda;<sup>odd</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) = &Lambda;<sup>1</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &oplus; &Lambda;<sup>3</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &oplus; &Lambda;<sup>5</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>)

<P>
and this big space forms the right-handed Weyl spinor representation
of Spin(10).  It's also irreducible.

<P>
I can't resist mentioning that there's also a gadget called the Hodge
star operator that maps &Lambda;<sup>even</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) to
&Lambda;<sup>odd</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>), and vice versa.  In
terms of physics, this sends left-handed particles into their
right-handed antiparticles, and vice versa!

<P>
But if I get into digressions like these, it'll take forever to tackle the
main question: how does this &quot;Weyl spinor&quot; stuff work?  

<P>
It takes advantage of some very nice general facts.  First, C<sup>n</sup> is
just another name for R<sup>2n</sup> equipped with the structure of a complex
vector space.  This makes SU(n) into a subgroup of SO(2n).  So, it
makes the Lie algebra su(n) into a Lie subalgebra of so(2n).

<P>
The group SU(n) acts on the exterior algebra &Lambda;(C<sup>n</sup>).  So, its Lie
algebra su(n) also acts on this space.  The really cool part is that
this action extends to all of so(2n).  This is something you learn
about when you study Clifford algebras, spinors and the like.  I don't
know how to explain it without writing down some formulas.  So, for
now, please take my word for it!

<P>
This business doesn't give a representation of SO(2n) on
&Lambda;(C<sup>n</sup>), but it gives a representation of the double
cover, Spin(2n).  This is called the &quot;Dirac spinor&quot;
representation.  It breaks up into two irreducible parts:

<P>
&Lambda;(C<sup>n</sup>) = &Lambda;<sup>even</sup>(C<sup>n</sup>) &oplus; &Lambda;<sup>odd</sup>(C<sup>n</sup>)

<P>
and these are called the left- and right-handed &quot;Weyl spinor&quot;
representations.

<P>
Perhaps it's time for an executive summary of what I've said so
far:

<blockquote>
The Dirac spinor representation of Spin(10) neatly encodes everything
about how one generation of fermions interacts with the gauge bosons
in the Standard Model, as long as we remember how S(U(2) &times; U(3)) sits
inside SO(10), which is double covered by Spin(10).
</blockquote>

Of course, there's more to the Standard Model than this.  There's also
the Higgs boson, which spontaneously breaks electroweak symmetry and
gives the fermions their masses.  And, if we want to use this same trick 
to break the symmetry from Spin(10) down to S(U(3) &times; U(2)), we need to
introduce <em>more</em> Higgs bosons.  This is the ugly part of the story, it
seems.  Since I'm on vacation, I'll avoid it for now.

<P>
Next: how might exceptional Lie groups get involved in this game?

<P>
When Cartan classified compact simple Lie groups, he found 3 infinite
families related to rotations in real, complex and quaternionic vector
spaces: the SO(n)'s, SU(n)'s and Sp(n)'s.  He also found 5 exceptions,
which have the charming names G<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>,
E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, and E<sub>8</sub>.  These are all
related to the octonions.  G<sub>2</sub> is just the automorphism
group of the octonions.  The other 4 are closely related to each other
- thanks to the &quot;magic square&quot; of Rosenfeld, Freudenthal and
Tits.

<P>
I talked about the magic square a bit in 
&quot;<A HREF = "week106.html">week106</A>&quot; and
&quot;<A HREF = "week145.html">week145</A>&quot;, and much more here:

<P>
3) John Baez, The magic square,
<a href = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node16.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node16.html</a>

<P>
Instead of repeating all that, let me just summarize.  The magic
square gives vector space isomorphisms as follows:

<P>
f<sub>4</sub> &cong; so(R &oplus; O) &oplus; (R &otimes; O)<sup>2</sup>         
                                 
<P>
e<sub>6</sub> &cong; so(C &oplus; O) &oplus; (C &otimes; O)<sup>2</sup> &oplus; Im(C) 
                                 
<P>
e<sub>7</sub> &cong; so(H &oplus; O) &oplus; (H &otimes; O)<sup>2</sup> &oplus; Im(H)

<P>
e<sub>8</sub> &cong; so(O &oplus; O) &oplus; (O &otimes; O)<sup>2</sup>

<P>
Here f<sub>4</sub>, e<sub>6</sub>, e<sub>7</sub> and e<sub>8</sub> stand for 
the Lie algebras of the compact real forms of these exceptional Lie groups.
R, C, H, and O are the usual suspects - the real numbers, 
complex numbers, quaternions and octonions.  For any real inner product 
space V, so(V) stands for the Lie algebra of the rotation group of V.  
And, for each of the isomorphisms above, we must equip the vector space 
on the right side with a cleverly (but not perversely!) defined Lie 
bracket to get the Lie algebra on the left side.   

<P>
Here's another way to say the same thing, which may ring more bells:

<P>
f<sub>4</sub> &cong; so(9)  &oplus; S<sub>9</sub>

<P>
e<sub>6</sub> &cong; so(10) &oplus; S<sub>10</sub> &oplus; u(1)

<P>
e<sub>7</sub> &cong; so(12) &oplus; S<sub>12</sub><sup>+</sup> &oplus; su(2)

<P>
e<sub>8</sub> &cong; so(16) &oplus; S<sub>16</sub><sup>+</sup>

<P>
Here S<sub>9</sub> and S<sub>10</sub> are the unique irreducible real 
spinor representations of so(9) and so(10), respectively.
In the other two cases, the little plus signs mean that there are 
two choices of irreducible real spinor representation, and we're taking 
the left-handed choice.

<P>
All this must seem like black magic of the foulest sort if you haven't
wasted months thinking about the octonions and exceptional groups!  
Be grateful: I did it so you wouldn't have to.  

<P>
Anyway: the case of E<sub>6</sub> should remind you of something!
After all, we've just been talking about so(10) and its left-handed
spinor representation.  These describe the gauge bosons and one
generation of left-handed fermions in the Spin(10) grand unified
theory.  But now we're seeing this stuff neatly packed into the Lie
algebra of E<sub>6</sub>!

<P>
More precisely, the Lie algebra of E<sub>6</sub> can be chopped into 3 pieces
in a noncanonical way: 

<ul>
<li>
so(10) 
</li>
<li>
the unique irreducible real spinor representation of so(10), which by now
we've given three different names: 
<P>
S<sub>10</sub> &cong; &Lambda;<sup>even</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>) &cong; (C &otimes; O)<sup>2</sup>
</li>
<li>
u(1)  
</li>
</ul>

<P>
The first part contains all the gauge bosons in the SO(10) grand unified
theory.  The second contains one generation of left-handed fermions.
But what about the third?  

<P>
Well, S<sub>10</sub> is defined to be a real
representation of so(10).  But, it just so happens that the action of
so(10) preserves a complex structure on this space.   This is just the
obvious complex structure on (C &otimes; O)<sup>2</sup>, or if you
prefer, &Lambda;<sup>even</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>).  So, there's
an action of the unit complex numbers, U(1), on
S<sub>10</sub> which commutes with the action of so(10).
Differentiating this, we get an action of the Lie algebra u(1):

<P>
u(1) &otimes; S<sub>10</sub> &rarr; S<sub>10</sub>
  
<P>
And this map gives part of the cleverly defined Lie bracket operation in

<P>
e<sub>6</sub> &cong; so(10) &oplus; S<sub>10</sub> &oplus; u(1)

<P>
All this stuff is mysterious, but suggestive.  It could be mere
coincidence, or it could be the tip of an iceberg.  It's more fun to
assume the latter.  So, let me say some more about it.... 

<P>
The copy of u(1) in here:

<P>
E<sub>6</sub> &cong; so(10) &oplus; S<sub>10</sub> &oplus; u(1)

<P>
is pretty amusing from a physics viewpoint.  It's if besides the gauge
bosons in so(10), there were one extra gauge boson whose sole role is
to describe the fact that the fermions form a <em>complex</em> representation
of so(10).  This is funny, since one of the naive ideas you sometimes 
hear is that you can take the obvious U(1) symmetry every complex Hilbert 
space has and &quot;gauge&quot; it to get electromagnetism.

<P>
That's not really the right way to understand electromagnetism!  There 
are lots of different irreducible representations of U(1), corresponding
to different charges, and in physics we should think about <em>all</em> of
these, not just the obvious one that we automatically get from any
complex Hilbert space.  If we only used the obvious one, all particles
would have charge 1.

<P>
But in the Spin(10) grand unified theory, the electromagnetic u(1) Lie
algebra is sitting inside so(10); it's not the u(1) you see above.
The u(1) you see above is the &quot;obvious&quot; one that the spinor
representation S<sub>10</sub> gets merely from being a
complex Hilbert space.

<P>
The splitting

<P>
e<sub>6</sub> = so(10) &oplus; S<sub>10</sub> &oplus; u(1)

<P>
also hints at a weird unification of bosons and fermions, something
different from supersymmetry.  We're seeing e<sub>6</sub> as a
Z/2-graded Lie algebra with so(10) &oplus; u(1) as its
&quot;bosonic&quot; part and S<sub>10</sub> as its
&quot;fermionic&quot; part.  But, this is not a Lie superalgebra, just
an ordinary Lie algebra with a Z/2 grading!

<P>
Furthermore, an ordinary Lie algebra with a Z/2 grading is precisely
what we need to build a &quot;symmetric space&quot;.  This is really cool,
since it explains what I meant by saying that the split of e<sub>6</sub> into
bosonic and fermionic parts is &quot;noncanonical&quot;.  We'll get a
space, and each point in this space will give a different way of
splitting e<sub>6</sub> as

<P>
e<sub>6</sub> = so(10) &oplus; S<sub>10</sub> &oplus; u(1)

<P>
It's also cool because it gives me an excuse to talk about symmetric
spaces...  a topic that deserves a whole week of its own!

<P>
Symmetric spaces are the epitome of symmetry.  A &quot;homogeneous
space&quot; is a manifold with enough symmetry that any point looks
like any other.  A symmetric space is a homogeneous space with
an extra property: the view from any point in any direction is the
same as the view in the opposite direction!

<P>
Euclidean spaces and spheres are the most famous examples of symmetric
spaces.  If an ant decides to set up residence on a sphere, any point 
is just as good any other.  And, if sits anywhere and looks in any 
direction, the view is the same as the view in the opposite direction.

<P>
The symmetric space we get from the above Z/2-graded Lie algebra is
similar, but more exotic: it's the complexified version of the 
octonionic projective plane!

<P>
But let's start with the basics:

<P>
Suppose someone hands you a Lie algebra g with a Lie subalgebra h.
Then you can form the simply-connected Lie group G whose Lie algebra
is g.  Sitting inside G, there's a connected Lie group H whose Lie 
algebra is h.  The space

<P>
G/H 

<P>
is called a &quot;homogeneous space&quot;.  Such things are studied in Klein 
geometry, and I've been talking about them a lot lately.

<P>
But now, suppose g is a Z/2-graded Lie algebra.  Its even part will be
a Lie subalgebra; call this h.  This gives a specially nice sort of
homogeneous space G/H, called a &quot;symmetric space&quot;.  This is
better than your average homogeneous space.  

<P>
Why?  Well, first of all, for each
point p in G/H there's a map from G/H to itself called
&quot;reflection through p&quot;, which fixes the point p and acts as
-1 on the tangent space of p.  When our point p comes from the identity
element of G, this reflection map corresponds to the Z/2
grading of the Lie algebra, which fixes the even part and acts as -1
on the odd part.   

<P>
This is what I meant by saying that in a symmetric space, &quot;the view in
any direction is the same as the view in the opposite direction&quot;.

<P>
Second, these reflection maps satisfy some nice equations.
Write p&gt;q for the the result of reflecting q through p.  Then we
have:

<P>
p&gt;(p&gt;q) = q

<P>
p&gt;p = p  

<P>
and 

<P>
p&gt;(q&gt;r) = (p&gt;q) &gt; (p&gt;r)                

<P>
A set with an operation satisfying these equations is called an
&quot;involutory quandle&quot;.  Quandles are famous in knot theory.
Now we're seeing them in another role.

<P>
Let me summarize with a few theorems - I hope they're all true,
because I don't know a book containing all this stuff.  We can define
a &quot;symmetric space&quot; to be an involutory quandle that's a
manifold, where the operation &gt; is smooth and the reflection map

<P>
x |&rarr;  p&gt;x

<P>
has derivative -1 at p.   Any Z/2-graded Lie algebra gives a symmetric 
space.   Conversely, any symmetric space has a universal cover that's a 
symmetric space coming from a Z/2-graded Lie algebra!
 
<P>
Using this correspondence, the Lie algebra e<sub>6</sub> with the
Z/2-grading I described gives a symmetric space, roughly:

<P>
E<sub>6</sub>/(Spin(10) &times; U(1))

<P>
But, this guy is a lot better than your average symmetric space!

<P>
For starters, it's a &quot;Riemannian symmetric space&quot;.  This is
a symmetric space with a Riemannian metric that's preserved by all the
operations of reflection through points.

<P>
Compact Riemannian symmetric spaces were classified by Cartan, and you 
can see the classification here, in a big chart:

<P>
4) Riemannian symmetric spaces, Wikipedia, 
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_symmetric_space">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_symmetric_space</a>

<P>
As you'll see, there are 7 infinite families and 12 exceptional cases.
The symmetric space I'm talking about now, namely E<sub>6</sub>/(Spin(10) &times; U(1)),
is called EIII - it's the third exceptional case.  And, as you can see 
from the chart in this article, it's the complexified version of the
octonionic projective plane!  For this reason, I sometimes call it 

<P>
(C &otimes; O)P<sup>2</sup>

<P>
In fact, this space is better than your average Riemannian symmetric 
space.   It's a K&auml;hler manifold, thanks to that copy of U(1), which
makes each tangent space complex.  Moreover, the K&auml;hler structure is 
preserved by all the operations of reflection through points.  So, 
it's a &quot;hermitian symmetric space&quot;.

<P>
You're probably drowning under all this terminology unless you already 
know this stuff.  I guess it's time for another executive summary:

<blockquote>
Each point in the complexified octonionic projective plane gives a
different way of splitting the Lie algebra of E<sub>6</sub> into a
bosonic part and a fermionic part.  The fermionic part is just what we
need to describe one generation of left-handed Standard Model
fermions.  The bosonic part is just what we need for the gauge bosons
of the Spin(10) grand unified theory, together with a copy of u(1),
which describes the <em>complex structure</em> of the left-handed
Standard Model fermions.  </blockquote>

<P>
Another nice fact is that (C &otimes; O)P<sup>2</sup> is one of the
Grassmannians for E<sub>6</sub>.  I explained this general notion of
&quot;Grassmannian&quot; back in &quot;<A HREF =
"week181.html">week181</A>&quot;, and you can see this 16-dimensional
one in the list near the end of that Week.

<P>
Even better, if you geometrically quantize this Grassmannian using the
smallest possible symplectic structure, you get the 27-dimensional
representation of E<sub>6</sub> on the exceptional Jordan algebra!

<P>
So, there's a lot of seriously cool math going on here... but since
the basic idea of relating the Standard model to E<sub>6</sub> is only
half-baked, all the ideas I'm mentioning now are at best
quarter-baked.  They're mathematically correct, but I can't tell if
they're leading somewhere interesting.

<P>
In fact, I would have kept them in the oven longer had not Garrett
Lisi brought E<sub>6</sub>'s big brother E<sub>8</sub> into the game
in a tantalizing way.  I'll conclude by summarizing this... and you
can look at his website for more details.  But first, let me emphasize
that this E<sub>8</sub> business is the most recent and most
speculative thing Garrett has done.  So, if you think the following
idea is nuts, please don't jump to conclusions and decide <em>everything</em>
he's doing is nuts!

<P>
Briefly, his idea involves taking the description of e<sub>8</sub> I
already mentioned:

<P>
e<sub>8</sub> = so(O &oplus; O) &oplus; (O &otimes; O)<sup>2</sup>

<P>
and writing the linear transformations in so(O &oplus; O) as two
8&times;8 blocks living in so(O), together with an off-diagonal block
living in O &otimes; O.  This gives

<P>
e<sub>8</sub> = so(O) &oplus; so(O) &oplus; (O &otimes; O)<sup>3</sup>

<P>
Then, he wants to use each of the three copies of O &otimes; O to
describe one of the three generations of fermions, while using the
so(O) &oplus; so(O) stuff to describe bosons (including gravity).

<P>
For this, he builds on some earlier work where he sought to combine
gravity, the Standard Model gauge bosons, the Higgs and <em>one</em>
generation of Standard Model fermions in an so(7,1) version of
MacDowell-Mansouri gravity.

<P>
If I were really being responsible, I would describe and assess this 
earlier work.  But, it's summer and I just want to have fun....

<P>
In fact, the above alternate description of E<sub>8</sub> is the one Bertram
Kostant told me about back in 1996.  He said it a different way, which
is equivalent:

<P>
E<sub>8</sub> = so(8) &oplus; so(8) &oplus; End(V<sub>8</sub>) &oplus; End(S<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>) &oplus; End(S<sub>8</sub><sup>-</sup>)

<P>
Here V<sub>8</sub>, S<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup> and
S<sub>8</sub><sup>-</sup> are the vector, left-handed spinor, and
right-handed spinor representations of Spin(8).  All three are
8-dimensional, and all are related by outer automorphisms of Spin(8).
That's what &quot;triality&quot; is all about.  You can see more
details in &quot;<A HREF = "week90.html">week90</A>&quot;.

<P>
The idea of relating the three generations to triality is cute.  Of
course, even if it worked, you'd need something to give the fermions
in different generations different masses - which is what happens
already in the Standard Model, thanks to the Higgs boson.  It's the
bane of all post-Standard Model physics: symmetry looks nice, but the
more symmetry your model has, the more symmetries you need to explain
away!  As the White Knight said to Alice:

<blockquote>
   But I was thinking of a plan <br/>
   To dye one's whiskers green, <br/>
   And always use so large a fan <br/>
   That they could not be seen. <br/>
</blockquote>

<P>
Someday we may think of a way around this problem.  But for now, I've got 
a more pressing worry.  This splitting of E<sub>6</sub>:

<P>
E<sub>6</sub> = so(10) &oplus; S<sub>10</sub><sup>+</sup> &oplus; u(1)

<P>
corresponds to a Z/2-grading where so(10) &oplus; u(1) is the
&quot;bosonic&quot; or &quot;even&quot; part and
S<sub>10</sub><sup>+</sup> is the &quot;fermionic&quot; or
&quot;odd&quot; part.  This nicely matches the way so(10) describes
gauge bosons and S<sub>10</sub><sup>+</sup> describes fermions in
Georgi's grand unified theory.  But, this splitting of E<sub>8</sub>:

<P>
E<sub>8</sub> = so(8) &oplus; so(8) &oplus; End(V<sub>8</sub>) &oplus;
End(S<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>) &oplus; End(S<sub>8</sub><sup>-</sup>)

<P>
does not correspond to any Z/2-grading where so(8) &oplus; so(8) is
the bosonic part and End(V) &oplus; End(S<sup>+</sup>) &oplus;
End(S<sup>-</sup>) is the fermionic part.  There is a closely related
Z/2-grading of E<sub>8</sub>, but it's this:

<P>
E<sub>8</sub> = so(16) &oplus; S<sub>16</sub><sup>+</sup>

<P>
So, right now I don't feel it's mathematically natural to use this method
to combine bosons and fermions.  

<P>
But, only time will tell.

All this stuff is really cool - but alas, they get the &quot;minimal
supersymmetric Standard Model&quot;, or MSSM, which has a lot more
particles than the Standard Model, and a lot more undetermined
parameters.  Of course, these flaws could become advantages if the 
next big particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, sees 
signs of supersymmetry.

<b>Addendum:</b>
Joseph Hucks points out his paper describing the 13 different
groups with Lie algebra su(3) &oplus; su(2) &oplus; u(1), and their 
implications for physics:

<p>
18) Joseph Hucks, Global structure of the standard model, anomalies, 
and charge quantization, Phys. Rev. D 43 (1991), 2709-2717.

<p>
Using S(U(3) &times; U(2)) and demanding anomaly cancellation, we 
automatically get a lot of the features of the Standard Model fermions.

<p>
Toby Bartels wisely points out that my basic examples of symmetric
spaces - Euclidean spaces and sphere - are actually a bit misleading.
I'd written:

<blockquote>
Euclidean spaces and spheres are the most famous examples of symmetric
spaces.  If an ant decides to set up residence on a sphere, any point 
is just as good any other.  And, if sits anywhere and looks in any 
direction, the view is the same as the view in the opposite direction.
</blockquote>

But in these particular examples, the view in any direction is the
same as the view in <i>any other</i> direction!  These spaces are more  
symmetrical than your average symmetric space: they're 
<i>isotropic</i>.  

<p>
So, it's good to see some other examples, like a torus formed as the
product of two circles of different radii.  Any product of symmetric
spaces is a symmetric space, so this is definitely a symmetric space.
And, if you think about it, the ant's-eye view in any direction is
just the same as the view in the opposite direction.  But, this space
is not isotropic: there are special directions, corresponding to
&quot;the short way around the torus&quot; and &quot;the long way
around the torus&quot;.

<p>
The octonionic projective plane OP<sup>2</sup> is not only a symmetric
space: it's isotropic!  But according to Tony Smith,
the complexified version (C &#8855; O)P<sup>2</sup> is not 
isotropic:

<blockquote>
In Spaces of Constant Curvature, Fifth Edition (Publish or Perish 1984),
Joseph A. Wolf says (pages 293-294):

<blockquote>
<pre>
... M is called isotropic at x if I(M)<sub>x</sub> is transitive on
the unit sphere in M<sub>x</sub>;
it is isotropic if it is isotropic at every point.
...
M is isotropic if and only if it is two point homogeneous.
...
Let M be a riemannian symmetric space.
Then the following conditions are equivalent.
(i) M is two point homogeneous.
(ii) Either M is a euclidean space or M is irreducible and 
of rank 1.
</pre>
</blockquote>

Since (C &otimes; O)P<sup>2</sup> = E<sub>6</sub>/(SO(10) &times; SO(2)) 
is rank 2, it is NOT isotropic.
</blockquote>

<p>
In the quote by Wolf, I can only guess that I(M)<sub>x</sub> is the
group of isometries of M that fix the point x, while M<sub>x</sub> is
the tangent space of M at x.  Similarly, I guess that &quot;two point
homogeneous&quot; means that for any D &ge; 0, the isometry group of M
acts transitively on the set of pairs of points in M whose distance
from each other is D.

<p>
I also thank Tony for correcting some errors involving spinors.  
There's some quite subtle stuff going on here.  For example, above
it says that:

<blockquote>
Well, S<sub>10</sub> is defined to be a real
representation of so(10).  But, it just so happens that the action of
so(10) preserves a complex structure on this space.   This is just the
obvious complex structure on (C &otimes; O)<sup>2</sup>, or if you
prefer, &Lambda;<sup>even</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>).  So, there's
an action of the unit complex numbers, U(1), on
S<sub>10</sub><sup>+</sup> which commutes with the action of so(10).
</blockquote>

But in fact, so(10) preserves <i>two</i> complex structures on
S<sub>10</sub>.  This is how it always works: if some complex
structure J is preserved by some group or Lie algebra action, so is
-J.  In the case at hand, one of these makes the representation of
so(10) into a complex representation isomorphic to its left-handed
Weyl spinor representation on &Lambda;<sup>even</sup>
(C<sup>5</sup>).  The other gives the right-handed Weyl spinor
representation on &Lambda;<sup>odd</sup>(C<sup>5</sup>).
Neither one of these is &quot;more correct&quot; than the other.  So,
whenever I talk about e<sub>6</sub> as being related to one generation
of left-handed Standard Model fermions, I could equally well say
&quot;right-handed Standard Model fermions&quot;.  It just depends on
which complex structure we choose!

<p>
Furthermore, when we complexify the real Lie algebra e<sub>6</sub>, we
get 

<p>
C &otimes; e<sub>6</sub> &cong; so(10,C) &oplus; &Lambda;(C<sup>5</sup>) &oplus; C
<p>

where &Lambda;(C<sup>5</sup>) is the Dirac spinor representation of
so(10,C), describing both left- and right-handed fermions.
