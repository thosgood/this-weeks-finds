<!-- END HEADER -->


<P>
Next week I'm going to New York to talk about the stuff I've been
explaining here lately: electrical circuits and category theory. 
Then - volcanos permitting - I'll fly to Oxford to attend a course
on quantum computation:

<P>
1) Foundational Structures in Quantum Computation and Information,
May 24-28, 2010, Oxford University, organized by Bob Coecke and 
Ross Duncan, 
<a href = "http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Bob.Coecke/QICS_School.html">http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Bob.Coecke/QICS_School.html</a>

<P>
I look forward to lots of interesting conversations.  A bunch of my
math pals will be attending - folks like Bruce Bartlett, Eugenia
Cheng, Simon Willerton, Jamie Vicary and maybe even my former student
Alissa Crans, who lives here in California, but may swing by.  I'll
talk to Thomas Fischbacher about environmental sustainability and
computational field theory, and Dan Ghica about hardware description
languages.  I also plan to meet Tim Palmer, a physicist at Oxford who
works on climate and weather prediction, and one of the people I've
been interviewing for the new This Week's Finds.  I'm quite excited
about that.

<P>
(My plan, you see, is to interview people who are applying math and
physics to serious practical problems, from global warming and other
environmental problems to biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial
intelligence and other potentially revolutionary technologies.)

<P>
The weekend after the course, there will be a workshop:  

<P>
2) Quantum Physics and Logic, May 29-30, 2010, Oxford University,
organized Bob Coecke, Prakash Panangaden, and Peter Selinger, <a href
=
"http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Bob.Coecke/QPL_10.html">http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/Bob.Coecke/QPL_10.html</a>

<P>
Peter Selinger is the guy who got me interested in categories where
the morphisms are electrical circuits!  I'll be giving a talk in this
workshop - you can see the slides here:

<P>
3) John Baez, Duality in logic and physics, <a href = 
"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dual/">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/dual/</a>

<P>
Alas, I've been so busy getting ready for my talks that I don't feel 
like writing about electrical circuits today.  I was going to, but I 
need a change of pace.  So let me say a bit about octonions, higher 
gauge theory, string theory and hyperdeterminants.

<P>
Integers are very special real numbers.  But there are also
&quot;integers&quot; for the complex numbers, the quaternions and
octonions.  The most famous are the &quot;Gaussian integers&quot;,
which are complex numbers like

<P>
a + bi 

<P>
where a and b are integers.  They form a square lattice like this:

<P>
<div align = "center">
<img src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/conway_smith/gaussian.gif">
</div>
         
<P>
The second most famous are the &quot;Eisenstein integers&quot;, which
form a hexagonal lattice like this:

<P>
<div align = "center">
<img src = "http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/conway_smith/eisenstein.gif">
</div>

<P>
I explained how these lattices are important in string theory back in
&quot;<a href = "week124.html">week124</A>&quot; - &quot;<a href =
"week126.html">week126</A>&quot;.

<P>
People have also thought about various kinds of far less well-known
are various kinds of quaternionic and octonionic &quot;integers&quot;.
To learn about these, there's no better place than the magnificent
book by Conway and Smith:

<P>
4) John H. Conway and Derek A. Smith, On Quaternions and Octonions: 
Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry, A. K. Peters, Ltd., Natick, 
Massachusetts, 2003. 

<P>
For a little taste, try my summary in &quot;<a href =
"week194.html">week194</A>&quot;, and my review here:

<P>
5) John Baez, review of On Quaternions and Octonions, Bull. Amer. 
Math. Soc. 42 (2005), 229-243.  Also available at 
<a href = "http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2005-42-02/S0273-0979-05-01043-8/">http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2005-42-02/S0273-0979-05-01043-8/</a>

<P>
You'll meet the Lipschitz integers and Hurwitz integers sitting inside
the quaternions - and the Lipschitzian, Hurwitzian and Gravesian
integers sitting inside the octonions.  I suspect all these charming
names are due to Conway, who has a real gift for terminology.  But
best of all are the Cayley integers, which form a famous 8-dimensional
lattice: the E<sub>8</sub> lattice!  This gives the densest lattice
packing of spheres in 8 dimensions: each sphere touches 240 others.

<P>
But you've heard me rhapsodizing about E<sub>8</sub> for years.
What's new this week?  Well, recently I was perusing a draft of a
paper on various kinds of quaternionic and octonionic integers, which
was kindly sent to me by Norman Johnson.  I'm afraid that paper is
still top secret, but an interesting issue came up.

<P>
People know all the finite subgroups of the unit quaternions,
otherwise known as SU(2), the double cover of the 3d rotation group.
The most famous of these are:

<P>
<ul>
<li>
   the 24-element <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tetrahedral_group">binary tetrahedral group</a>
</li>
<p>
<li>
   the 48-element <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_octahedral_group">binary octahedral group</a>
</li>
<p>
<li>
   the 120-element <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_icosahedral_group">binary icosahedral group</a>
</li>
</ul>

<P>
These are the double covers of the rotational symmetry groups of the
Platonic solids.  Since beautiful structures like this have a way of
connecting diverse subjects, you shouldn't be surprised that these
groups show up all over in math, from the McKay correspondence and
Klein's work on the quintic equation (see &quot;<a href =
"week65.html">week65</A>&quot; and &quot;<a href =
"week230.html">week230</A>&quot;) to the theory of modular forms (see
&quot;<a href = "week197.html">week197</A>&quot;).  I've talked about
the binary icosahedral group many times before: it's also called
the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120-cell">120-cell</a>, 
and projected down to 3 dimensions it looks like this:

<p>
<div align = "center">
<img width = "400" src = "120-cell.png"> 
</div>
<p>

But the best place
to learn the classification of finite subgroups of the unit quaternions
is the book by Conway and Smith.

<P>
For some idiotic reason I'd never pondered the analogous question for
the octonions until Norman Johnson brought it up!  The unit octonions
form a 7-dimensional sphere.  They don't form a group, since
multiplication of octonions isn't associative.  But they form a
&quot;loop&quot;, which is just like a group but with the associative
law dropped.  Since they're a smooth manifold, and the group
operations are smooth, they form a &quot;Lie loop&quot;.

<P>
In fact the only spheres that are Lie groups are:

<P>
<ul>
<li>
   the unit real numbers: the 0-sphere, also called Z/2 or O(1)
</li>
<p>
<li>
   the unit complex numbers: the 1-sphere, also called SO(2) or U(1)
</li>
<p>
<li>
   the unit quaternions: the 3-sphere, also called SU(2) or Sp(1)
</li>
</ul>

<P>
And the only other sphere that's a &quot;Lie loop&quot; is the unit
octonions!  So we can - and should! - ask: what are the finite
subloops of the unit octonions?

<P>
Michael Kinyon, an expert on loops, quickly provided two references
that settle the question:

<P>
6) R. T. Curtis, Construction of a family of Moufang loops,
Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 142 (2007), 233-237.

<P>
7) P. Boddington and D. Rumynin, On Curtis' theorem about finite 
octonionic loops, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 135 (2007), 1651-1657.
Available at 
<a href = "http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/2007-135-06/S0002-9939-07-08707-2/">http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/2007-135-06/S0002-9939-07-08707-2/</a>

<P>
There are no huge surprises here.  The most exciting finite subloop
has 240 elements: it consists of the Cayley integers of length 1,
otherwise known as the root vectors of E<sub>8</sub>.  You've probably
seen this thing:

<P>
<div align = "center">
<img src = "e8_stembridge.jpg">
</div>

<P>
The rest of the
finite subloops are either finite subgroups of the unit quaternions or
&quot;doubles&quot; of these.  No exotic beasts I hadn't dreamt of.
But it's very nice to know the full story!

<P>
I also have some other news on the octonionic front.  John Huerta and
I wrote a second paper on division algebras and supersymmetry, where
we explain how to construct the &quot;Lie n-superalgebras&quot; that
govern classical superstring and super-2-brane theories:

<P>
8) John Baez and John Huerta, Supersymmetry and division algebras II,
available as <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.3436">arXiv:1003.3436</a>.

<P>
As you may know, Lie groups and their Lie algebras are incredibly
important in gauge theory, which describe how particles
change when you move them around.  Lately people have been developing
&quot;higher gauge theory&quot;, which does the same job for strings
and higher-dimensional membranes.  For strings we need Lie 2-groups
and their Lie 2-algebras.  Lie 2-groups are like Lie groups except
that they're <i>categories</i> instead of sets... and similarly for Lie
2-algebras.  Go up one more dimension and you need math based on
<i>2-categories</i>.  So, for 2-branes, which look like soap bubbles
instead of loops of string, you need Lie 3-groups and their Lie
3-algebras.  Etcetera.

<P>
So, the race is on to construct, classify and understand Lie n-groups
and Lie n-algebras - and redo all of geometry to take advantage of 
these higher structures!  For an easy introduction, try:

<P>
9) John Baez and John Huerta, An invitation to higher gauge theory,
available as <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4485">arXiv:1003.4485</a>.

<P>
But for supersymmetric theories, geometry based on manifolds isn't
enough: we need supermanifolds.  The world is made of bosons and
fermions, and supersymmetry is an attempt to unite them.  So, a
supermanifold has ordinary &quot;even&quot; or &quot;bosonic&quot;
coordinate functions that commute with each other, but also
&quot;odd&quot; or &quot;fermionic&quot; coordinate functions that
anticommute.  For the last few decades people have been redoing
geometry using supermanifolds.  As part of this, they've done a lot of
work to construct, classify and understand Lie supergroups and their
Lie superalgebras.

<P>
Superstring theory combines supersymmetry and higher-dimensional 
membranes in a beautiful way.  It's never made any predictions about 
the real world, and it may never succeed in doing that.  But it's been 
a real boon for mathematicians.  And here's another example: we can 
now enjoy ourselves developing a theory of Lie n-supergroups and their 
Lie n-superalgebras! 

<P>
I might feel guilty indulging in such decadent pleasures, were it not
that I plan to start work on more practical projects.
But having spent years thinking about division algebras and higher
gauge theory, it was irresistible to combine them - especially since
my student John Huerta has a knack for this stuff.

<P>
And here's what we discovered: 

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
  The real numbers give rise to a Lie 2-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical superstrings in 3d spacetime.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  The complex numbers give rise to a Lie 2-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical superstrings in 4d spacetime.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  The quaternions give rise to a Lie 2-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical superstrings in 6d spacetime.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  The octonions give rise to a Lie 2-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical superstrings in 10d spacetime.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
3, 4, 6 and 10 - these are two more than the dimensions of the real
numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions.  I've discussed
this pattern many times here.  But then we discovered something else:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
  The real numbers give rise to a Lie 3-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical super-2-branes in 4d spacetime.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  The complex numbers give rise to a Lie 3-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical super-2-branes in 5d spacetime.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  The quaternions give rise to a Lie 3-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical super-2-branes in 7d spacetime.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  The octonions give rise to a Lie 3-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical super-2-branes in 11d spacetime.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
4, 5, 7 and 11 - these are <i>three</i> more than the dimensions of
the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions!  And the
11d case is related to &quot;M-theory&quot; - that mysterious dream
you've probably heard people muttering about.

<P>
You might ask if the pattern keeps going on, like this:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
  Do the real numbers give rise to a Lie 4-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical super-3-branes in 5d spacetime?
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  Do the complex numbers give rise to a Lie 4-superalgebra which
  describes the symmetries of classical super-3-branes in 6d
  spacetime?  
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  Do the quaternions give rise to a Lie 4-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical super-3-branes in 8d spacetime?
</LI>
<P>
<LI>
  Do the octonions give rise to a Lie 4-superalgebra which describes
  the symmetries of classical super-3-branes in 12d spacetime?
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
But some calculations by Tevian Dray and John Huerta, together with a
lot of physics lore, suggest that the pattern does <i>not</i> keep
going on - at least not for the most exciting case, the octonionic
case.  You can see what I mean by looking at the &quot;brane
scan&quot; in this classic paper by Duff:

<P>
The story seems to fizzle out after 11 dimensions.  And that's part of
what intrigues me about division algebras and related exceptional
structures in math: the funny fragmentary patterns that don't go on
forever.

<P>
Recently Peter Woit criticized Duff for some remarks in this article:

<P>
11) Michael Duff, Black holes and qubits, CERN Courier May 5, 2010.  
Available at <a href = "http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/42328">http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/42328</a>

<P>
12) Peter Woit, Applying string theory to quantum information theory,
<a href = "http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=2952">http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=2925</a>

<P>
Duff's article describes how he noticed some of the same math showing
up in superstring calculations of black hole entropy and patterns of
quantum entanglement between qubits.  This leads into some nice math
involving octonions and related exceptional structures like the Fano
plane and Cayley's &quot;hyperdeterminants&quot;.

<P>
Unfortunately, Duff gets a bit carried away.  For example, he says that
string theory &quot;predicts&quot; the various ways that three qubits
can be entangled.  Someone who didn't know physics might jump to the
conclusion that this is a prediction whose confirmation lends credence
to string theory as a description of the fundamental constituents of
nature.  It's not!

<P>
I also doubt that &quot;superquantum computing&quot; is likely to be
practical...  though I've read interesting things about supersymmetry
in graphene, so I could wind up eating my words.

<P>
On the other hand, the math is fascinating.  For details, try these
papers:

E<sub>7</sub>, available as <a href =

<P>
Since I've spent a lot of time talking about the Fano plane, the
octonions, and exceptional groups like E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>
and E<sub>8</sub>, let me say just a word or two about
hyperdeterminants.

<P>
In the 1840's, after his work on determinants, Arthur Cayley invented
a theory of &quot;hyperdeterminants&quot; for 2 &times; 2 &times; 2
arrays of numbers.  They're a bit like determinants of 2 &times; 2
matrices, but more complicated.  They lay dormant for about a century,
but were recently revived by three bigshots: Gel'fand, Kapranov and
Zelevinsky.  I never understood them, but when Woit called them
&quot;extraordinarily obscure&quot;, it was like waving a red flag in
front of a bull.  I charged forward... and now I sort of understand
them, at least a little.

<P>
Suppose we have a 2 &times; 2 matrix of complex numbers.  We can think
of this as an element of the Hilbert space

<P>
C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup>

<P>
so we get a linear functional

<P>
C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> &rarr; C

<P>
sending any vector to its inner product with this element.  We can 
then regard this linear functional as a function

<P>
f: C<sup>2</sup> &times; C<sup>2</sup> &rarr; C 

<P>
that's linear in each argument.  Is there a nonzero 
point in C<sup>2</sup> &times; C<sup>2</sup> 
where the gradient of f vanishes?  The answer is yes if and only if 
the determinant of our 2 &times; 2 matrix is zero!  

<P>
Next, suppose we have a 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 array of complex numbers.  
We can think of this as an element of the Hilbert space

<P>
C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup>

<P>
so we get a linear functional

<P>
C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> &rarr; C

<P>
sending any vector to its inner product with this element.  We can 
then regard this linear functional as a function

<P>
f: C<sup>2</sup> &times; C<sup>2</sup> &times; C<sup>2</sup> &rarr; C 

<P>
that's linear in each argument.  Is there a nonzero point in
C<sup>2</sup> &times; C<sup>2</sup> &times; C<sup>2</sup> where the
gradient of f vanishes?  The answer is yes if and only if the
hyperdeterminant of our 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 array is zero!

<P>
Here's another way to think about it.  Suppose you have a quantum 
system made of 3 subsystems, each described by a 2d Hilbert space.  
The Hilbert space of the whole system is thus

<P>
C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup>

<P>
The hyperdeterminant is a function on this space that can be thought
of as measuring how correlated - or to use a bit of jargon,
&quot;entangled&quot; - the 3 subsystems are.  In particular, if we
look at unit vectors modulo phase, we get the projective space
CP<sup>7</sup>.  The group

<P>
GL(2,C) &times; GL(2,C) &times; GL(2,C)

<P>
acts on this.  There's an open dense orbit, coming from the vectors 
whose hyperdeterminant is nonzero.  These states are quite entangled,
as you'd expect: entanglement is not an exceptional situation, it's 
generic.   And then there are various smaller orbits, going down to 
the 1-point orbit coming from vectors like

<P>
u &otimes; v &otimes; w

<P>
These describe states with no entanglement at all!

<P>
We can make what I'm saying a bit more precise at the expense of 
a little more math.  The polynomial functions on 
C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> that are
invariant under the action of SL(2,C) &times; SL(2,C) &times; SL(2,C)
form an algebra, 
and this algebra is generated by the hyperdeterminant, which is a
homogeneous cubic polynomial.  (Why did I switch from GL(2,C) to SL(2,C)?
Because the hyperdeterminant is not invariant
under the bigger group GL(2,C) &times; GL(2,C) &times; GL(2,C). 
However, it comes close: it gets multiplied by a scalar in a simple way.)

<p>
If we try to generalize this idea
to tensor products of more spaces, like
C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; C<sup>2</sup> &otimes; 
C<sup>2</sup> we typically get an algebra that's not generated by a 
single polynomial. The same happens if we jack up the dimension,
for example replacing C<sup>2</sup> by C<sup>9</sup>.  So, the situations
where a single polynomial does the job are special.

<p>
As an extra lure, let me add that you can write the Lagrangian for a
string in (2+2)-dimensional spacetime using 2 &times; 2 &times; 2
hyperdeterminants!  The formula is very pretty and simple:

<b>Addenda:</b> On August 8th 2010, I received the following mail from
Péter Lévay, who has allowed me to quote it here:

<blockquote>
   Dear John,

<P>

   I used to read your fascinating blog.  Recently I have come across 
   your "week298" post (14 May) concerning hyperdeterminants and 
   reflections on a paper by Duff which appeared in CERN Courier on 
   the black hole qubit correspondence.

<P>
   Since I know that you are really fascinated by octonions, 
   Freudenthal systems, etc., with this mail I intend to draw your 
   attention to papers of mine connected to the stuff of your 
   "week298" post.  Moreover, I would also like to add some further 
   hints (which Duff does not mention) why this analogy is worth 
   working out further.

<P>
   Originally I used to work on the field of quantum entanglement, and 
   group theoretical and geometrical methods in quantum physics.  My 
   paper: 

<P>
   19) Péter Lévay, The twistor geometry of three-qubit entanglement,
   available as <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0403060">arXiv:quant-ph/0403060</a>.

<P>
   on the "Cayley" hyperdeterminant, twistors and three qubit 
   entanglement was the one that motivated originally Duff's work 
   (as he mentions in the CERN Courier).  Later I have written 
   another paper on the four qubit case (hyperdeterminant):

<P>
   After Duff's and Kallosh and Linde's paper I have shown that the 
   black hole qubit analogy also works for issues concerning DYNAMICS.
   I have shown that the attractor mechanism (a process used for moduli 
   stabilization on the BH horizon) can be rephrased in this picture 
   as a distillation procedure of GHZ-like states:

   The physical nature of these moduli, charge and warp factor 
   dependent "states" (or whether is it legitimate to call them 
   states at all) is, however, still unclear.

<P>
   Independently of Duff and Ferrara during the summer of 2006 I worked 
   out the E7 tripartite entanglement of seven qubits picture.  My 
   paper came out later because I have bogged down on some maths 
   details (I also wanted to see the E7 generators in the 56 dim rep. 
   acting as qubit gates - without success!)  However, the idea that 
   this curious type of entanglement is related to the structure of 
   the Fano plane appears first in this paper:

<P>
   Here I made the conjecture that Freudenthal systems and issues 
   concerning the magic square could be relevant to further 
   developments of the black hole qubit analogy, initiating the nice 
   study of Duff <i>et al</i>, culminating in their valuable Phys. Reports 
   paper.

<P>
   In the meanwhile with my student we have shown that Freudenthal 
   systems are capable of giving hints for solving the classification 
   problem of entanglement classes for systems consisting of special 
   types of indistinguishable constituents (fermions and bosons).  The 
   black hole entropy formulas of string theory and supergravity also 
   gave suggestions how to define sensible (tripartite) entanglement 
   measures for these systems:

   and the Freudenthal construction, available as  <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.2269">arXiv:0902.2269</a>.

<P>
   Apart from these studies after realizing the relevance of finite 
   geometric ideas with a Slovak co-worker Metod Saniga we have shown 
   that the structure of the E6 and E7 invariants giving rise to black 
   hole entropy formulas are related to generalizations of Mermin 
   Square like configurations, and generalized polygons.  Our studies 
   motivated partly the nice paper of van Geemen and B. L Cerchiai you 
   mention in your post ("From qubits to E7").  Since the finite 
   geometric structures relevant to the black hole qubit 
   correspondence turned out to be just geometric hyperplanes of 
   incidence geometries for n-qubit systems, we conducted a 
   mathematical study on the structure of such hyperplanes giving rise 
   to another incidence geometry: the Veldkamp space.  The nice maths 
   results can be found in:

   qubits, available as  <a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3655"> arXiv:0906.3655</a>.

<P>
   Such notions as symplectic structure, quadratic forms, 
   transvections, and the group Sp(2n,2) connected to n-qubit 
   systems and black holes appear here.  The language of this paper 
   is similar to the van Geemen paper.

<P>
   Recently I have shown that certain solutions of the STU model 
   living in 4D and coming from one sector of the E7(7) invariant 
   N=8 SUGRA Duff mentions in his paper in connection to three qubits, 
   is really a model living in 3D coming from a coset of E8(8)
   related to FOUR QUBITS.  In this paper I have given hints that the 
   classification problem for four qubits can be translated to the 
   classification problem of black hole solutions (BPS and non BPS, 
   extremal and even possibly non extremal).

<P>
   (The idea that four qubit systems show up in STU truncations 
   first appeared in my Fano-E7 paper.  This is 
   related to the structure of a coset of SO(4,4), with triality 
   making its debut via permutation of the qubits.)

<P>
   Based on the results of this paper the  challenge  to relate 
   the BH classification problem based on four qubit systems by 
   fitting together the existing results in the literature was 
   recently taken up by Duff <i>et al</i>.

<P>
   I hope that these results add some useful hints to update the 
   picture on the black hole qubit correspondence.

<P>
   I think that the main virtue of this field is that fascinating 
   maths (like octonions, Freudenthal systems, finite geometries 
   etc.) will finally makes its debut to understanding quantum 
   entanglement better.  On the string theory side such studies 
   might initiate some new way of looking at existing results in 
   the field of stringy black hole solutions.

<P>
   Of course finding the underlying physics (if any) is still out 
   there!

<em>Quaternions appear to exude an air of nineteenth century decay, as
a rather unsuccessful species in the struggle-for-life of mathematical
ideas.  Mathematicians, admittedly, still keep a warm place in their
hearts for the remarkable algebraic properties of quaternions but,
alas, such enthusiasm means little to the harder-headed physical
scientist.</em> - Simon L. Altmann
